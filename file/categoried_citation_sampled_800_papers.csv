29025408,Synteny analysis of genes and distribution of loci controlling oil content and fatty acid profile based on QTL alignment map in Brassica napus.,"Deciphering the genetic architecture of a species is a good way to understand its evolutionary history, but also to tailor its profile for breeding elite cultivars with desirable traits. Aligning QTLs from diverse population in one map and utilizing it for comparison, but also as a basis for multiple analyses assure a stronger evidence to understand the genetic system related to a given phenotype. In this study, 439 genes involved in fatty acid (FA) and triacylglycerol (TAG) biosyntheses were identified in Brassica napus. B. napus genome showed mixed gene loss and insertion compared to B. rapa and B. oleracea, and C genome had more inserted genes. Identified QTLs for oil (OC-QTLs) and fatty acids (FA-QTLs) from nine reported populations were projected on the physical map of the reference genome ""Darmor-bzh"" to generate a map. Thus, 335 FA-QTLs and OC-QTLs could be highlighted and 82 QTLs were overlapping. Chromosome C3 contained 22 overlapping QTLs with all trait studied except for C18:3. In total, 218 candidate genes which were potentially involved in FA and TAG were identified in 162 QTLs confidence intervals and some of them might affect many traits. Also, 76 among these candidate genes were found inside 57 overlapping QTLs, and candidate genes for oil content were in majority (61/76 genes). Then, sixteen genes were found in overlapping QTLs involving three populations, and the remaining 60 genes were found in overlapping QTLs of two populations. Interaction network and pathway analysis of these candidate genes indicated ten genes that might have strong influence over the other genes that control fatty acids and oil formation. The present results provided new information for genetic basis of FA and TAG formation in B. napus. A map including QTLs from numerous populations was built, which could serve as reference to study the genome profile of B. napus, and new potential genes emerged which might affect seed oil. New useful tracks were showed for the selection of population or/and selection of interesting genes for breeding improvement purpose.",10.1186/s12864-017-4176-6,True,high,True,high,"[""Brassica napus""]","[""fatty acid biosynthesis"", ""triacylglycerol synthesis"", ""QTL mapping for oil content""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Brassica napus""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""In this study, 439 genes involved in fatty acid (FA) and triacylglycerol (TAG) biosyntheses were identified in Brassica napus."", ""Interaction network and pathway analysis of these candidate genes indicated ten genes that might have strong influence over the other genes that control fatty acids and oil formation.""], ""explanation"": ""The paper explicitly identifies genes linked to fatty acid and triacylglycerol biosynthesis, maps quantitative trait loci for oil content and fatty acids, and analyzes pathways affecting lipid production, demonstrating a clear focus on lipid-related processes."", ""specific_topics"": [""fatty acid biosynthesis"", ""triacylglycerol synthesis"", ""QTL mapping for oil content""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",1: Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways,success,1.0,Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways
29425344,DEWAX2 Transcription Factor Negatively Regulates Cuticular Wax Biosynthesis in Arabidopsis Leaves.,"The aerial parts of terrestrial plants are covered with hydrophobic wax layers, which represent the primary barrier between plant cells and the environment and act to protect plants from abiotic and biotic stresses. Although total wax loads are precisely regulated in an environmental- or organ-specific manner, regulatory mechanisms underlying cuticular wax biosynthesis remain largely unknown. In this study, we characterized DEWAX2 (DECREASE WAX BIOSYNTHESIS2) which encodes an APETALA 2 (AP2)/ethylene response element-binding factor (ERF)-type transcription factor and is predominantly expressed in young seedlings, and rosette and cauline leaves. Total wax loads increased by approximately 12% and 16% in rosette and cauline leaves of dewax2, respectively, but were not significantly altered in the stems of dewax2 relative to the wild type (WT). The excess wax phenotype of dewax2 leaves was rescued upon expression of DEWAX2 driven by its own promoter. Overexpression of DEWAX2 decreased total wax loads by approximately 15% and 26% in the stems and rosette leaves compared with those of the WT, respectively. DEWAX2:eYFP (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein) was localized to the nucleus in Arabidopsis roots and hypocotyls. DEWAX2 possessed transcriptional repression activity in tobacco protoplasts. Transcriptome and quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that the transcript levels of CER1, ACLA2, LACS1, LACS2 and KCS12 were down-regulated in DEWAX2 overexpression lines compared with the WT. Transient transcriptional assays showed that DEWAX2 represses the expression of its putative target genes. Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR revealed that DEWAX2 binds directly to the GCC motifs of the LACS1, LACS2, KCS12 and CER1 promoters. These results suggest that DEWAX2-mediated transcriptional repression may contribute to the total wax load in Arabidopsis leaves.",10.1093/pcp/pcy033,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""cuticular wax biosynthesis"", ""fatty acid elongation"", ""lipid metabolism""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""The aerial parts of terrestrial plants are covered with hydrophobic wax layers, which represent the primary barrier between plant cells and the environment and act to protect plants from abiotic and biotic stresses."", ""Transcriptome and quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that the transcript levels of CER1, ACLA2, LACS1, LACS2 and KCS12 were down-regulated in DEWAX2 overexpression lines compared with the WT.""], ""explanation"": ""Cuticular waxes are complex lipids derived from very-long-chain fatty acids.

11807123,Role of ethylene in the biosynthetic pathway of aliphatic ester aroma volatiles in Charentais Cantaloupe melons.,"Compared to other melon types, Cantaloupe Charentais melons are highly aromatic with a major contribution to the aroma being made by aliphatic and branched esters. Using a transgenic line in which the synthesis of the plant hormone ethylene has been considerably lowered by antisense ACC oxidase mRNA (AS), the aliphatic ester pathway steps at which ethylene exerts its regulatory role were found. The data show that the production of aliphatic esters such as hexyl and butyl acetate was blocked in AS fruit and could be reversed by ethylene. Using fruit discs incubated in the presence of various precursors, the steps at which ester formation was inhibited in AS fruit was shown to be the reduction of fatty acids and aldehydes, the last step of acetyl transfer to alcohols being unaffected. However, treating AS fruit with the ethylene antagonist 1-methylcyclopropene resulted in about 50% inhibition of acetyl transfer activity, indicating that this portion of activity was ethylene-dependent and this was supported by the low residual ethylene concentration of AS fruit discs (around 2 microl l(-1)). In conclusion, the reduction of fatty acids and aldehydes appears essentially to be ethylene-dependent, whilst the last step of alcohol acetylation has ethylene-dependent and ethylene-independent components, probably corresponding to differentially regulated alcohol acetyltransferases.",10.1093/jexbot/53.367.201,True,high,True,high,"[""Cucumis melo""]","[""fatty acid reduction"", ""ester biosynthesis"", ""ethylene regulation""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Cucumis melo""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Using fruit discs incubated in the presence of various precursors, the steps at which ester formation was inhibited in AS fruit was shown to be the reduction of fatty acids and aldehydes, the last step of acetyl transfer to alcohols being unaffected."", ""The data show that the production of aliphatic esters such as hexyl and butyl acetate was blocked in AS fruit and could be reversed by ethylene.""], ""explanation"": ""The study examines how ethylene influences the conversion of fatty acids into aliphatic esters in melon fruit, directly implicating fatty acid metabolism and lipid-related enzymatic pathways in aroma compound biosynthesis."", ""specific_topics"": [""fatty acid reduction"", ""ester biosynthesis"", ""ethylene regulation""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",1: Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways,success,1.0,Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways
24119222,Bottlenecks in erucic acid accumulation in genetically engineered ultrahigh erucic acid Crambe abyssinica.,"Erucic acid is a valuable industrial fatty acid with many applications. The main producers of this acid are today high erucic rapeseed (Brassica napus) and mustard (Brassica juncea), which have 45%-50% of erucic acid in their seed oils. Crambe abyssinica is an alternative promising producer of this acid as it has 55%-60% of erucic acid in its oil. Through genetic modification (GM) of three genes, we have previously increased the level of erucic acid to 71% (68 mol%) in Crambe seed oil. In this study, we further investigated different aspects of oil biosynthesis in the developing GM Crambe seeds in comparison with wild-type (Wt) Crambe, rapeseed and safflower (Carthamus tinctorius). We show that Crambe seeds have very low phosphatidylcholine-diacylglycerol interconversion, suggesting it to be the main reason why erucic acid is limited in the membrane lipids during oil biosynthesis. We further show that GM Crambe seeds have slower seed development than Wt, accompanied by slower oil accumulation during the first 20 days after flowering (DAF). Despite low accumulation of erucic acid during early stages of GM seed development, nearly 86 mol% of all fatty acids accumulated between 27 and 50 DAF was erucic acid, when 40% of the total oil is laid down. Likely bottlenecks in the accumulation of erucic acid during early stages of GM Crambe seed development are discussed.",10.1111/pbi.12128,True,high,True,high,"[""Crambe abyssinica""]","[""erucic acid accumulation"", ""phosphatidylcholine\u2011diacylglycerol interconversion"", ""oil biosynthesis in seeds""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Crambe abyssinica""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Erucic acid is a valuable industrial fatty acid with many applications."", ""We show that Crambe seeds have very low phosphatidylcholine\u2011diacylglycerol interconversion, suggesting it to be the main reason why erucic acid is limited in the membrane lipids during oil biosynthesis.""], ""explanation"": ""The manuscript investigates the synthesis and accumulation of erucic acid, a long-chain fatty acid, in genetically modified Crambe abyssinica seeds, including analyses of lipid intermediates and developmental dynamics of oil biosynthesis."", ""specific_topics"": [""erucic acid accumulation"", ""phosphatidylcholine\u2011diacylglycerol interconversion"", ""oil biosynthesis in seeds""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",1: Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways,success,1.0,Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways
9247548,Cuphea wrightii thioesterases have unexpected broad specificities on saturated fatty acids.,"Cuphea wrightii A. Gray is an herbaceous annual that accumulates 30% caprate (10:0) and 54% laurate (12:0) in seed storage lipids. We investigated the role of acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) thioesterases (TE) in acyl chain-length regulation in C. wrightii. Two embryo-derived cDNAs, encoding the TEs Cw FatB1 and Cw FatB2, were isolated. Both proteins were detected in developing embryos and mature seeds but not in other tissues, suggesting involvement in seed oil synthesis. Although expected to be 10:0/12:0-ACP-specific, these genes produced a broad range of fatty acids (12:0, 14:0, and 16:0) in transgenic Arabidopsis with the greatest accumulation at 14:0. Cw FatB2 transformants also accumulated small amounts of 10:0. Because C. wrightii accumulates only ca. 5% 14:0 and ca. 2% 16:0, we tested the possibility that gene dosage effects might significantly alter the overall kinetics of the pathway. Phenotypic comparisons of progeny segregating for the transgenes individually and in a hybrid population demonstrated that increased enzyme pools in vivo had a minor effect on diverting fatty acid production to shorter chains. We propose that Cw FatB1 and Cw FatB2 may be necessary but not sufficient determinants of the C. wrightii phenotype.",10.1023/a:1005846830784,True,high,True,high,"[""Cuphea wrightii""]","[""fatty acid biosynthesis"", ""thioesterase activity"", ""seed oil composition""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Cuphea wrightii""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Cuphea wrightii A.

10899973,The arabidopsis DELAYED DEHISCENCE1 gene encodes an enzyme in the jasmonic acid synthesis pathway.,"delayed dehiscence1 is an Arabidopsis T-DNA mutant in which anthers release pollen grains too late for pollination to occur. The delayed dehiscence1 defect is caused by a delay in the stomium degeneration program. The gene disrupted in delayed dehiscence1 encodes 12-oxophytodienoate reductase, an enzyme in the jasmonic acid biosynthesis pathway. We rescued the mutant phenotype by exogenous application of jasmonic acid and obtained seed set from previously male-sterile plants. In situ hybridization studies showed that during the early stages of floral development, DELAYED DEHISCENCE1 mRNA accumulated within all floral organs. Later, DELAYED DEHISCENCE1 mRNA accumulated specifically within the pistil, petals, and stamen filaments. DELAYED DEHISCENCE1 mRNA was not detected in the stomium and septum cells of the anther that are involved in pollen release. The T-DNA insertion in delayed dehiscence1 eliminated both DELAYED DEHISCENCE1 mRNA accumulation and 12-oxophytodienoate reductase activity.

18544608,The Arabidopsis cytochrome P450 CYP86A1 encodes a fatty acid omega-hydroxylase involved in suberin monomer biosynthesis.,"The lipophilic biopolyester suberin forms important boundaries to protect the plant from its surrounding environment or to separate different tissues within the plant. In roots, suberin can be found in the cell walls of the endodermis and the hypodermis or periderm. Apoplastic barriers composed of suberin accomplish the challenge to restrict water and nutrient loss and prevent the invasion of pathogens. Despite the physiological importance of suberin and the knowledge of the suberin composition of many plants, very little is known about its biosynthesis and the genes involved. Here, a detailed analysis of the Arabidopsis aliphatic suberin in roots at different developmental stages is presented. This study demonstrates some variability in suberin amount and composition along the root axis and indicates the importance of omega-hydroxylation for suberin biosynthesis. Using reverse genetics, the cytochrome P450 fatty acid omega-hydroxylase CYP86A1 (At5g58860) has been identified as a key enzyme for aliphatic root suberin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. The corresponding horst mutants show a substantial reduction in omega-hydroxyacids with a chain length <C(20), demonstrating that CYP86A1 functions as a hydroxylase of root suberized tissue. Detailed expression studies revealed a strong root specificity and a localized expression in the root endodermis. Transgenic expression of CYP86A1 fused to GFP distributed CYP86A1 to the endoplasmic reticulum, indicating that suberin monomer biosynthesis takes place in this sub-cellular compartment before intermediates are exported in the apoplast.",10.1093/jxb/ern101,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""omega-hydroxylation"", ""suberin biosynthesis"", ""cytochrome P450 enzymes""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Using reverse genetics, the cytochrome P450 fatty acid omega-hydroxylase CYP86A1 (At5g58860) has been identified as a key enzyme for aliphatic root suberin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis."", ""The corresponding horst mutants show a substantial reduction in omega-hydroxyacids with a chain length <C(20), demonstrating that CYP86A1 functions as a hydroxylase of root suberized tissue.""], ""explanation"": ""The study focuses on the enzymatic conversion of fatty acids via omega\u2011hydroxylation, a key step in the synthesis of suberin monomers, thereby directly investigating lipid metabolism processes."", ""specific_topics"": [""omega-hydroxylation"", ""suberin biosynthesis"", ""cytochrome P450 enzymes""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",1: Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways,success,1.0,Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways
19700560,CYP704B1 is a long-chain fatty acid omega-hydroxylase essential for sporopollenin synthesis in pollen of Arabidopsis.,"Sporopollenin is the major component of the outer pollen wall (exine). Fatty acid derivatives and phenolics are thought to be its monomeric building blocks, but the precise structure, biosynthetic route, and genetics of sporopollenin are poorly understood. Based on a phenotypic mutant screen in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), we identified a cytochrome P450, designated CYP704B1, as being essential for exine development. CYP704B1 is expressed in the developing anthers. Mutations in CYP704B1 result in impaired pollen walls that lack a normal exine layer and exhibit a characteristic striped surface, termed zebra phenotype. Heterologous expression of CYP704B1 in yeast cells demonstrated that it catalyzes omega-hydroxylation of long-chain fatty acids, implicating these molecules in sporopollenin synthesis. Recently, an anther-specific cytochrome P450, denoted CYP703A2, that catalyzes in-chain hydroxylation of lauric acid was also shown to be involved in sporopollenin synthesis. This shows that different classes of hydroxylated fatty acids serve as essential compounds for sporopollenin formation. The genetic relationships between CYP704B1, CYP703A2, and another exine gene, MALE STERILITY2, which encodes a fatty acyl reductase, were explored. Mutations in all three genes resulted in pollen with remarkably similar zebra phenotypes, distinct from those of other known exine mutants. The double and triple mutant combinations did not result in the appearance of novel phenotypes or enhancement of single mutant phenotypes.

19463193,Breeding response of transcript profiling in developing seeds of Brassica napus.,"The upgrading of rapeseed cultivars has resulted in a substantial improvement in yield and quality in China over the past 30 years. With the selective pressure against fatty acid composition and oil content, high erucic acid- and low oil-content cultivars have been replaced by low erucic acid- and high oil-content cultivars. The high erucic acid cultivar Zhongyou 821 and its descendent, low erucic acid cultivar Zhongshuang 9, are representatives of two generations of the most outstanding Chinese rapeseed cultivars (B. napus) developed the past 2 decades. This paper compares the transcriptional profiles of Zhongshuang 9 and Zhongyou 821 for 32 genes that are principally involved in lipid biosynthesis during seed development in order to elucidate how the transcriptional profiles of these genes responded to quality improvement over the past 20 years. Comparison of the cultivar Zhongyou 821 with its descendent, Zhongshuang 9, shows that the transcriptional levels of seven of the 32 genes were upregulated by 30% to 109%, including FAD3, ACCase, FAE1, GKTP, Caleosin, GAPDH, and PEPC. Of the 32 genes, 10 (KAS3, beta-CT, BcRK6, P450, FatA, Oleosin, FAD6, FatB, alpha-CT and SUC1) were downregulated by at least 20% and most by 50%. The Napin gene alone accounted for over 75% of total transcription from all 32 genes assessed in both cultivars. Most of the genes showed significant correlation with fatty acid accumulation, but the correlation in ZS9 was significantly different from that in ZY821. Higher KCR2 activity is associated with higher C16:0, C18:0, and C18:2 in both cultivars, lower C22:1 and total fatty acid content in ZY821, and lower 18:1 in ZS9. This paper illustrates the response of the transcription levels of 32 genes to breeding in developing rapeseed seeds. Both cultivars showed similar transcription profiles, with the Napin gene predominantly transcribed. Selective pressure for zero erucic acid, low glucosinolate, high oleic acid and high oil content, as well as high yield, resulted in higher FAD3, ACCase, FAE1, GKTP, Caleosin, GAPDH, and PEPC expression levels and lower KAS3, beta-CT, BcRK6, P450, FatA, Oleosin, FAD6, FatB, alpha-CT and SUC1 expression levels.

However, the molecular regulatory mechanism of oil accumulation in sunflowers is still unclear. In this study, we selected two inbred lines with significant differences in oleic acid content and similar agronomic traits: the high oleic acid content (82.5%) inbred line 227 and the low oleic acid content (30.8%) inbred line 228. Sunflower seeds were selected for transcriptome experiments at 10, 20, and 30 days after full bloom (DAFB).

14535881,Formation of plant cuticle: evidence for the occurrence of the peroxygenase pathway.,"Cuticle plays a major role as a protective barrier in plants. Despite its physiological importance, the mode of formation of this complex structure remains poorly understood. In particular, none of the putative enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the cutin, the matrix of cuticle, have been cloned. We have shown previously that peroxygenase is able to catalyze in vitro the epoxidation step required for the biosynthesis of C18 cutin monomers. In the present work, we have confirmed in planta that this oxidase is indeed a key enzyme involved in the formation of cutin. Thus, in maize leaves, the specific inactivation of peroxygenase by organophosphorothioates resulted in a dramatic decrease of cuticular epoxide content, as visualized by a specific histochemical technique that was accompanied by a reduced thickness of the cuticle. A strict correlation could also be established between the extent of inhibition of the peroxygenase and the modification of the cuticle triggered by a family of structurally related inhibitors. Importantly, these effects were restricted to plants that contain a cutin originating from C18 monomers. The altered cuticle of maize, treated with the peroxygenase inhibitor, was characterized by an increased permeability to pesticides. In addition, such plants became largely susceptible to infection by fungi, implying that the cuticle represents a crucial target for the modulation of the response in plant-pathogen interactions.",10.1046/j.1365-313x.2003.01865.x,True,high,True,high,"[""Zea mays""]","[""cutin biosynthesis"", ""epoxidation of fatty acid monomers"", ""lipid-based plant defense""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Zea mays""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""peroxygenase is able to catalyze in vitro the epoxidation step required for the biosynthesis of C18 cutin monomers."", ""Importantly, these effects were restricted to plants that contain a cutin originating from C18 monomers.""], ""explanation"": ""The study focuses on the enzymatic oxidation of C18 fatty acid-derived monomers during cutin biosynthesis, a key lipid metabolic process in plants."", ""specific_topics"": [""cutin biosynthesis"", ""epoxidation of fatty acid monomers"", ""lipid-based plant defense""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",1: Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways,success,1.0,Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways

This study provides functional characterization of three 3 ketoacyl CoA synthase like proteins in Vitis vinifera (one) and Oryza brachyantha (two proteins). Sequence analysis reveals that protein of Oryza brachyantha shows 96% similarity to a hypothetical protein in Sorghum bicolor; total 11 homologs were predicted in Sorghum bicolor. Conserved domain prediction confirm the presence of FAE1/Type III polyketide synthase-like protein, Thiolase-like, subgroup; Thiolase-like and 3-Oxoacyl-ACP synthase III, C-terminal and chalcone synthase like domain but very long chain 3-keto acyl CoA domain is absent. All three proteins were found to have Chalcone and stilbene synthases C terminal domain which is similar to domain of thiolase and β keto acyl synthase. Its N terminal domain is absent in J3M9Z7 protein of Oryza brachyantha and F6HH63 protein of Vitis vinifera. Differences in N-terminal domain is responsible for distinguish activity. The J3MF16 protein of Oryza brachyantha contains N terminal domain and C terminal domain and characterized using annotation of these domains.

26836315,AAE13 encodes a dual-localized malonyl-CoA synthetase that is crucial for mitochondrial fatty acid biosynthesis.,"Malonyl-CoA is a key intermediate in a number of metabolic processes associated with its role as a substrate in acylation and condensation reactions. These types of reactions occur in plastids, the cytosol and mitochondria, and although carboxylation of acetyl-CoA is the known mechanism for generating the distinct plastidial and cytosolic pools, the metabolic origin of the mitochondrial malonyl-CoA pool is still unclear. In this study we demonstrate that malonyl-CoA synthetase encoded by the Arabidopsis AAE13 (AT3G16170) gene is localized in both the cytosol and the mitochondria. These isoforms are translated from two types of transcripts, one that contains and one that does not contain a mitochondrial-targeting pre-sequence. Whereas the cytosolic AAE13 protein is not essential, due to the presence of a redundant malonyl-CoA generating system provided by a cytosolic acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the mitochondrial AAE13 protein is essential for plant growth. Phenotypes of the aae13-1 mutant are transgenically reversed only if the mitochondrial pre-sequence is present in the ectopically expressed AAE13 proteins. The aae13-1 mutant exhibits typical metabolic phenotypes associated with a deficiency in the mitochondrial fatty acid synthase system, namely depleted lipoylation of the H subunit of the photorespiratory enzyme glycine decarboxylase, increased accumulation of glycine and glycolate and reduced levels of sucrose. Most of these metabolic alterations, and associated morphological changes, are reversed when the aae13-1 mutant is grown in a non-photorespiratory condition (i.e. a 1% CO2 atmosphere), demonstrating that they are a consequence of the deficiency in photorespiration due to the inability to generate lipoic acid from mitochondrially synthesized fatty acids.",10.1111/tpj.13130,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""fatty acid synthesis"", ""lipoylation"", ""photorespiration""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Malonyl-CoA is a key intermediate in a number of metabolic processes associated with its role as a substrate in acylation and condensation reactions."", ""The aae13-1 mutant exhibits typical metabolic phenotypes associated with a deficiency in the mitochondrial fatty acid synthase system, namely depleted lipoylation of the H subunit of the photorespiratory enzyme glycine decarboxylase, increased accumulation of glycine and glycolate and reduced levels of sucrose.""], ""explanation"": ""The study characterizes a malonyl\u2011CoA synthetase that supplies substrates for mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis, directly linking to lipid metabolism and affecting lipoylation-dependent pathways."", ""specific_topics"": [""fatty acid synthesis"", ""lipoylation"", ""photorespiration""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",1: Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways,success,1.0,Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways

To understand the functions of 3-ketoacyl-acyl-carrier protein synthase I (KASI) in tobacco, we isolated two KASI homologs, which we have designated NtKASI-1 and NtKASI-2. Expression analysis showed that these two KASI genes were transcribed constitutively in all tissues examined. Over-expression of NtKASI-1 in tobacco changed the fatty acid content in leaves, whereas over-expressed lines of NtKASI-2 exhibited distinct phenotypic features such as slightly variegated leaves and reduction of the fatty acid content in leaves, similar to the silencing plants of NtKASI-1 gene. Interestingly, the silencing of NtKASI-2 gene had no discernibly altered phenotypes compared to wild type. The double silencing plants of these two genes enhanced the phenotypic changes during vegetative and reproductive growth compared to wild type. These results uncovered that these two KASI genes had the partially functional redundancy, and that the KASI genes played a key role in regulating fatty acids synthesis and in mediating plant growth and development in tobacco.",10.3390/ijms17081287,True,high,True,high,"[""Nicotiana tabacum""]","[""fatty acid biosynthesis"", ""gene expression regulation"", ""plant development""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Nicotiana tabacum""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Fatty acids serve many functions in plants, but the effects of some key genes involved in fatty acids biosynthesis on plants growth and development are not well understood yet."", ""Over\u2011expression of NtKASI\u20111 in tobacco changed the fatty acid content in leaves, whereas over\u2011expressed lines of NtKASI\u20112 exhibited distinct phenotypic features such as slightly variegated leaves and reduction of the fatty acid content in leaves, similar to the silencing plants of NtKASI\u20111 gene.""], ""explanation"": ""The study examines how KASI genes influence fatty acid synthesis and consequently affect plant growth and development in tobacco."", ""specific_topics"": [""fatty acid biosynthesis"", ""gene expression regulation"", ""plant development""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",1: Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways,success,1.0,Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways

We have characterized a four-member family of fatty acyl thioesterases from Arabidopsis thaliana, which we have called acyl-lipid thioesterase1 (ALT1), ALT2, ALT3, and ALT4. The ALTs belong to the Hotdog fold superfamily of thioesterases. ALT-like genes are present in diverse plant taxa, including dicots, monocots, lycophytes, and microalgae. The four Arabidopsis ALT genes were found to have distinct gene expression profiles with respect to each other. ALT1 was expressed specifically in stem epidermal cells and flower petals. ALT2 was expressed specifically in root endodermal and peridermal cells as well as in stem lateral organ boundary cells. ALT3 was ubiquitously expressed in aerial and root tissues and at much higher levels than the other ALTs. ALT4 expression was restricted to anthers. All four proteins were localized in plastids via an N-terminal targeting sequence of about 48 amino acids. When expressed in Escherichia coli, the ALT proteins used endogenous fatty acyl-acyl carrier protein substrates to generate fatty acids that varied in chain length (C6-C18), degree of saturation (saturated and monounsaturated), and oxidation state (fully reduced and β-ketofatty acids). Despite their high amino acid sequence identities, each enzyme produced a different profile of lipids in E. coli.

26617468,Differential abundance analysis of mesocarp protein from high- and low-yielding oil palms associates non-oil biosynthetic enzymes to lipid biosynthesis.,"The oil palm Elaeis guineensis Jacq. which produces the highest yield per unit land area of the oil crops is the most important commercial oil crop in South East Asia. The fleshy mesocarp of oil palm fruit, where oil is mostly derived from, contains up to 90 % dry weight of oil (one of the most concentrated in plant tissues). Hence, there is attention given to gain insights into the processes of oil deposition in this oil rich tissue. For that purpose, two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (DIGE) coupled with western assays, were used here to analyze differential protein levels in genetically-related high-and low-yielding oil palm mesocarps. From the DIGE comparative analysis in combination with western analysis, 41 unique differentially accumulated proteins were discovered. Functional categorization of these proteins placed them in the metabolisms of lipid, carbohydrate, amino acids, energy, structural proteins, as well as in other functions. In particular, higher abundance of fructose-1,6-biphosphate aldolase combined with reduced level of triosephosphate isomerase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase may be indicative of important flux balance changes in glycolysis, while amino acid metabolism also appeared to be closely linked with oil yield. Forty-one proteins in several important biological pathways were identified as exhibiting differential in abundance at critical oil production stages. These confirm that oil yield is a complex trait involving the regulation of genes in multiple biological pathways.

21790813,Combined activity of LACS1 and LACS4 is required for proper pollen coat formation in Arabidopsis.,"Very long chain lipids are important components of the plant cuticle that establishes the boundary surface of aerial organs. In addition, these lipids were detected in the extracellular pollen coat (tryphine), where they play a crucial role in appropriate pollen-stigma communication. As such they are involved in the early interaction of pollen with the stigma. A substantial reduction in tryphine lipids was shown to compromise pollen germination and, consequently, resulted in male sterility. We investigated the role of two long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (LACSs) in Arabidopsis with respect to their contribution to the production of tryphine lipids. LACS was shown to provide CoA-activated very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA-CoAs) to the pathways of wax biosynthesis. The allocation of sufficient quantities of VLCFA-CoA precursors should therefore be relevant to the generation of tryphine lipids. Here, we report on the identification of lacs1 lacs4 double knock-out mutant lines that were conditionally sterile and showed significant reductions in pollen coat lipids. Whereas the contributions of both LACS proteins to surface wax levels were roughly additive, their co-operation in tryphine lipid biosynthesis was clearly more complex. The inactivation of LACS4 resulted in increased levels of tryphine lipids accompanied by morphological anomalies of the pollen grains. The additional inactivation of LACS1 neutralized the morphological defects, decreased the tryphine lipids far below wild-type levels and resulted in conditionally sterile pollen.",10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04722.x,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""very long chain fatty acids"", ""pollen coat lipids"", ""wax biosynthesis""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Very long chain lipids are important components of the plant cuticle that establishes the boundary surface of aerial organs."", ""LACS was shown to provide CoA-activated very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA-CoAs) to the pathways of wax biosynthesis.""], ""explanation"": ""The study focuses on long\u2011chain acyl\u2011CoA synthetases (LACS1 and LACS4) that activate very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and supply them for wax and pollen coat lipid biosynthesis in Arabidopsis, directly investigating lipid metabolism."", ""specific_topics"": [""very long chain fatty acids"", ""pollen coat lipids"", ""wax biosynthesis""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",1: Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways,success,1.0,Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways

26138876,Increased production of wax esters in transgenic tobacco plants by expression of a fatty acid reductase:wax synthase gene fusion.,"Wax esters are hydrophobic lipids consisting of a fatty acid moiety linked to a fatty alcohol with an ester bond. Plant-derived wax esters are today of particular concern for their potential as cost-effective and sustainable sources of lubricants. However, this aspect is hampered by the fact that the level of wax esters in plants generally is too low to allow commercial exploitation. To investigate whether wax ester biosynthesis can be increased in plants using transgenic approaches, we have here exploited a fusion between two bacterial genes together encoding a single wax ester-forming enzyme, and targeted the resulting protein to chloroplasts in stably transformed tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) plants. Compared to wild-type controls, transgenic plants showed both in leaves and stems a significant increase in the total level of wax esters, being eight-fold at the whole plant level. The profiles of fatty acid methyl ester and fatty alcohol in wax esters were related, and C16 and C18 molecules constituted predominant forms. Strong transformants displayed certain developmental aberrations, such as stunted growth and chlorotic leaves and stems. These negative effects were associated with an accumulation of fatty alcohols, suggesting that an adequate balance between formation and esterification of fatty alcohols is crucial for a high wax ester production.

7624314,An oleate 12-hydroxylase from Ricinus communis L. is a fatty acyl desaturase homolog.,"Recent spectroscopic evidence implicating a binuclear iron site at the reaction center of fatty acyl desaturases suggested to us that certain fatty acyl hydroxylases may share significant amino acid sequence similarity with desaturases. To test this theory, we prepared a cDNA library from developing endosperm of the castor-oil plant (Ricinus communis L.) and obtained partial nucleotide sequences for 468 anonymous clones that were not expressed at high levels in leaves, a tissue deficient in 12-hydroxyoleic acid.

28521208,Molecular cloning and characterization of two β-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase I genes from Jatropha curcas L.,"The β-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase I (KASI) is involved in de novo fatty acid biosynthesis in many organisms. Two putative KASI genes, JcKASI-1 and JcKASI-2, were isolated from Jatropha curcas. The deduced amino acid sequences of JcKASI-1 and JcKASI-2 exhibit around 83.8% and 72.5% sequence identities with AtKASI, respectively, and both contain conserved Cys-His-Lys-His-Phe catalytic active sites. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that JcKASI-2 belongs to a clade with several KASI proteins from dicotyledonous plants. Both JcKASI genes were expressed in multiple tissues, most strongly in filling stage seeds of J. curcas. Additionally, the JcKASI-1 and JcKASI-2 proteins were both localized to the plastids. Expressing JcKASI-1 in the Arabidopsis kasI mutant rescued the mutant's phenotype and restored the fatty acid composition and oil content in seeds to wild-type, but expressing JcKASI-2 in the Arabidopsis kasI mutant resulted in only partial rescue.

Analyses of Arabidopsis plants with transgenes encoding a microalgal polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) synthase revealed that small RNA (sRNA)-mediated silencing, combined with the use of repetitive regulatory elements, led to aggressive transposon-like silencing of canola-biased PUFA synthase transgenes. Diversifying regulatory sequences and using native microalgal coding sequences (CDSs) with higher GC content improved transgene expression and resulted in a remarkable trans-generational stability via reduced accumulation of sRNAs and DNA methylation. Further experiments in maize with transgenes individually expressing three crystal (Cry) proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) tested the impact of CDS recoding using different codon bias tables. Transgenes with higher GC content exhibited increased transcript and protein accumulation.

19759341,Identification of an Arabidopsis feruloyl-coenzyme A transferase required for suberin synthesis.,"All plants produce suberin, a lipophilic barrier of the cell wall that controls water and solute fluxes and restricts pathogen infection. It is often described as a heteropolymer comprised of polyaliphatic and polyaromatic domains. Major monomers include omega-hydroxy and alpha,omega-dicarboxylic fatty acids, glycerol, and ferulate. No genes have yet been identified for the aromatic suberin pathway. Here we demonstrate that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) gene AT5G41040, a member of the BAHD family of acyltransferases, is essential for incorporation of ferulate into suberin. In Arabidopsis plants transformed with the AT5G41040 promoter:YFP fusion, reporter expression is localized to cell layers undergoing suberization. Knockout mutants of AT5G41040 show almost complete elimination of suberin-associated ester-linked ferulate. However, the classic lamellar structure of suberin in root periderm of at5g41040 is not disrupted. The reduction in ferulate in at5g41040-knockout seeds is associated with an approximate stoichiometric decrease in aliphatic monomers containing omega-hydroxyl groups. Recombinant AT5G41040p catalyzed acyl transfer from feruloyl-coenzyme A to omega-hydroxyfatty acids and fatty alcohols, demonstrating that the gene encodes a feruloyl transferase. CYP86B1, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase gene whose transcript levels correlate with AT5G41040 expression, was also investigated. Knockouts and overexpression confirmed CYP86B1 as an oxidase required for the biosynthesis of very-long-chain saturated alpha,omega-bifunctional aliphatic monomers in suberin. The seed suberin composition of cyp86b1 knockout was surprisingly dominated by unsubstituted fatty acids that are incapable of polymeric linkages. Together, these results challenge our current view of suberin structure by questioning both the function of ester-linked ferulate as an essential component and the existence of an extended aliphatic polyester.",10.1104/pp.109.144907,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""suberin biosynthesis"", ""feruloyl-CoA transferase activity"", ""fatty acid monomer composition""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Major monomers include omega-hydroxy and alpha,omega-dicarboxylic fatty acids, glycerol, and ferulate."", ""Recombinant AT5G41040p catalyzed acyl transfer from feruloyl-coenzyme A to omega-hydroxyfatty acids and fatty alcohols, demonstrating that the gene encodes a feruloyl transferase.""], ""explanation"": ""The study focuses on the lipid components of suberin, specifically fatty acid monomers and their enzymatic modification, indicating direct investigation of fatty acids and lipid processes."", ""specific_topics"": [""suberin biosynthesis"", ""feruloyl-CoA transferase activity"", ""fatty acid monomer composition""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",1: Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways,success,1.0,Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways
5725883,Lipid biosynthesis in chloroplast mutants of barley.,"The capacity of leaf slices from light-grown seedlings of wild type barley and 10 xantha mutants at six different gene loci to incorporate acetate-(14)C into various lipids has been investigated. The fatty acid composition of the leaf lipids in these lethal mutants was similar to that of the wild type, but the fatty acid labeling pattern in the individual lipid classes can be drastically altered by these mutations, which affect chloroplast differentiation. A genetic block in chlorophyll synthesis, caused by mutations in the xan-f locus, leads to a repression of the formation of chloroplast membranes and of acetate incorporation into phospho-, sulfo-, and galacto-lipids (the acetate being preferentially channeled into a lipid fraction containing steroids and free fatty acids). Two leucine ""auxotrophs"" at different loci, which in the absence of leucine in the growth medium produce giant grana and accumulate some chlorophyll, differed considerably in the amount of labeling of their polar lipids during incubation. Leaves of xan-a(11), containing plastids with little chlorophyll, highly disorganized membrane systems, and large bodies with osmiophilic deposits, were nonetheless equal to wild type in their capacity to incorporate acetate-(14)C into phospho-, sulfo-, and galacto-lipids. The mutants at the xan-m locus have plastids with undispersed prolamellar bodies and osmiophilic packages of grana-like membranes associations. Leaf slices of these mutants synthesized considerably more linolenic acid-(14)C, which was incorporated into monogalactosyl diglycerides, than did slices of the wild type.

7979400,Biochemical characterization of temperature-induced changes in lipid metabolism in a high oleic acid mutant of Brassica rapa.,"We have characterized a Brassica rapa mutant (WR586) that has low levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (D.L. Auld et al., 1992, Crop Sci. 32, 657-662). The mutant lacked oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine desaturase (ODS) activity when assayed in 6-day-old seedlings. To further characterize the mutant, the leaf fatty acid composition and major galactolipids and phospholipids were characterized in mutant (WR586) and control (cultivar ""Tobin"") plants grown at either 26 degrees C/26 degrees C or 10 degrees C/5 degrees C. Fatty acid profiles show significantly higher 18:1 levels in WR586 throughout 12 days of germination. The amount of saturated fatty acids decreased with a concomitant increase of 18:1. Ratios of 18:1/18:2 revealed that WR586 maintains higher mole percent of 18:1 than Tobin at all times and temperature regimes because of a lack of desaturation to 18:2. Values for monogalactosyl-diacylglycerol and digalactosyldiacylglycerol 18:1/18:2 ratios indicate a disparity in the concentration of 18:1 between WR586 and Tobin grown in either temperature during early germination. The phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine 18:1/18:2 ratios were higher in WR586 compared to Tobin and remained higher throughout the 12-day period. In WR586, 18:1 always accumulated to higher levels in the cooler temperature. In Tobin, 18:1 concentrations paralleled 18:2 in both temperature regimes. These results indicate that the lesion in the mutant WR586 resides at the ODS locus, 18:1 synthesis is chilling induced, and the microsomal desaturation pathway is the most prominent in early developing Brassica seedlings.",10.1006/abbi.1994.1491,True,high,True,high,"[""Brassica rapa""]","[""fatty acid composition"", ""lipid metabolism"", ""phospholipids"", ""galactolipids""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Brassica rapa""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""We have characterized a Brassica rapa mutant (WR586) that has low levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (D.L.

26339641,Heterologous Reconstitution of Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Arabidopsis.,"Reconstitution of nonnative, very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (VLC-PUFA) biosynthetic pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana was undertaken. The introduction of three primary biosynthetic activities to cells requires the stable coexpression of multiple proteins within the same cell. Herein, we report that C22 VLC-PUFAs were synthesized from C18 precursors by reactions catalyzed by Δ(6)-desaturase, an ELOVL5-like enzyme involved in VLC-PUFA elongation, and Δ(5)-desaturase. Coexpression of the corresponding genes (McD6DES, AsELOVL5, and PtD5DES) under the control of the seed-specific vicilin promoter resulted in production of docosapentaenoic acid (22:5 n-3) and docosatetraenoic acid (22:4 n-6) as well as eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 n-3) and arachidonic acid (20:4 n-6) in Arabidopsis seeds. The contributions of the transgenic enzymes and endogenous fatty acid metabolism were determined. Specifically, the reasonable synthesis of omega-3 stearidonic acid (18:4 n-3) could be a useful tool to obtain a sustainable system for the production of omega-3 fatty acids in seeds of a transgenic T3 line 63-1.

The IC(50) (the concentration of inhibitor that reduces enzyme activity by 50%) for the inhibition of Glc-6-P uptake was approximately 750 nM; inhibition was reversed by recombinant rapeseed (Brassica napus) acyl-CoA binding protein. In the presence of ATP (3 mM) and CoASH (coenzyme A; 0.3 mM), Glc-6-P uptake was inhibited by 60%, due to long-chain acyl-CoA synthesis, presumably from endogenous sources of fatty acids present in the preparations. Addition of oleoyl-CoA (1 microM) decreased carbon flux from Glc-6-P into the synthesis of starch and through the oxidative pentose phosphate (OPP) pathway by up to 73% and 40%, respectively.

27345821,Short-term phytotoxicity in Brassica napus (L.) in response to pre-emergently applied metazachlor: A microcosm study.,"In accordance with realistic application approaches, a short-term 1-factorial experiment was set up to investigate the phytotoxic impact of pre-emergent application of the chloroacetamide herbicide metazachlor on Brassica napus. In addition to morphological parameters, the underlying processes that ultimately determine the extent of herbicide-induced phytotoxicity (i.e., herbicide metabolization and cellular antioxidant defense) were examined. The present study demonstrated that metazachlor provoked fasciation of the leaves closely after emergence, which might be linked to its mode of action whereby cell division is impaired through the inhibition of very long chain fatty acid synthesis. The increased activities of antioxidative enzymes and metabolites in leaf tissue indicated the presence of reactive oxygen species under the influence of metazachlor. This resulted in oxidative damage in the form of membrane lipid peroxidation. Simultaneously, the increased activity of glutathione S-transferase and the shift in glutathione redox state suggested activation of the detoxification metabolism. This occurred, however, at the expense of growth, with a temporary reduction in plant height and weight after application. The results indicated that metazachlor disappeared within 3 mo to 4 mo after application, which resulted in the recovery of the crop. In conclusion, metazachlor induces phytotoxicity in the short term, either directly through its mode of action or indirectly through the induction of oxidative stress, which resulted in a temporary reduction in growth.

19843251,Molecular cloning and characterization of a KCS gene from Cardamine graeca and its heterologous expression in Brassica oilseeds to engineer high nervonic acid oils for potential medical and industrial use.,"Nervonic acid 24:1 Delta15 (cis-tetracos-15-enoic acid) is a very long-chain monounsaturated fatty acid and exists in nature as an elongation product of oleic acid. There is an increasing interest in production of high nervonic acid oils for pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and industrial applications. Using a polymerase chain reaction approach, we have isolated a gene from Cardamine graeca L., which encodes a 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS), the first component of the elongation complex involved in synthesis of nervonic acid. Expression of the Cardamine KCS in yeast resulted in biosynthesis of nervonic acid, which is not normally present in yeast cells. We transformed Arabidopsis and Brassica carinata with the Cardamine KCS under the control of the seed-specific promoter, napin. The T(3) generations of transgenic Arabidopsis and B. carinata plants expressing the Cardamine KCS showed that seed-specific expression resulted in relatively large comparative increases in nervonic acid proportions in Arabidopsis seed oil, and 15-fold increase in nervonic acid proportions in B. carinata seed oil. The highest nervonic acid level in transgenic B. carinata lines reached 44%, with only 6% of residual erucic acid. In contrast, similar transgenic expression of the Cardamine KCS in high erucic B. napus resulted in 30% nervonic acid but with 20% residual erucic acid. Experiments using the Lunaria KCS gene gave results similar to the latter. In both cases, the erucic acid content is too high for human or animal consumption. Thus, the Cardamine KCS: B. carinata high nervonic/highly reduced erucic transgenic seed oils will be the most suitable for testing in pharmaceutical/nutraceutical applications to improve human and animal health.",10.1111/j.1467-7652.2009.00454.x,True,high,True,high,"[""Cardamine graeca"", ""Arabidopsis thaliana"", ""Brassica carinata"", ""Brassica napus""]","[""fatty acid elongation"", ""very\u2011long\u2011chain fatty acids"", ""nervonic acid production""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Cardamine graeca"", ""Arabidopsis thaliana"", ""Brassica carinata"", ""Brassica napus""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Nervonic acid 24:1 Delta15 (cis-tetracos-15-enoic acid) is a very long-chain monounsaturated fatty acid and exists in nature as an elongation product of oleic acid."", ""Expression of the Cardamine KCS in yeast resulted in biosynthesis of nervonic acid, which is not normally present in yeast cells.""], ""explanation"": ""The study focuses on the enzymatic pathway responsible for synthesizing the fatty acid nervonic acid, a very\u2011long\u2011chain monounsaturated fatty acid, through the action of a 3\u2011ketoacyl\u2011CoA synthase (KCS).

26262563,Genetic control of cuticular wax compounds in Eucalyptus globulus.,"Plant cuticular wax compounds perform functions that are essential for the survival of terrestrial plants. Despite their importance, the genetic control of these compounds is poorly understood outside of model taxa. Here we investigate the genetic basis of variation in cuticular compounds in Eucalyptus globulus using quantitative genetic and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses. Quantitative genetic analysis was conducted using 246 open-pollinated progeny from 13 native sub-races throughout the geographic range. QTL analysis was conducted using 112 clonally replicated progeny from an outcross F2 population. Nine compounds exhibited significant genetic variation among sub-races with three exhibiting signals of diversifying selection. Fifty-two QTL were found with co-location of QTL for related compounds commonly observed. Notable among these was the QTL for five wax esters, which co-located with a gene from the KCS family, previously implicated in the biosynthesis of cuticular waxes in Arabidopsis. In combination, the QTL and quantitative genetic analyses suggest the variation and differentiation in cuticular wax compounds within E. globulus has a complex genetic origin.

However, the regulatory mechanisms of those pathways, their environmental interactions and the ecological implications of variation are poorly understood. We have initiated a new approach: the analysis of natural variation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Three hundred and sixty accessions were surveyed for content of oil, very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in their seeds. The results revealed extensive natural variation. A core set of accessions, the seeds of which reproducibly contain extreme amounts of oil, VLCFAs and PUFAs have been identified. Reproducible oil content ranged from 34.6 to 46.0% of seed dry weight. VLCFA content ranged from 13.0 to 21.2% of total fatty acids. PUFA content, ranged from 53.3 to 66.1% of total fatty acids. Interactions were also identified for PUFA and VLCFA content of seeds with vernalisation of plants. Mapping of the regions of the genome involved in controlling the traits was conducted in an F(2) population and indicated that natural variation at the loci FAE1 and FAD3 might be involved in the regulation of VLCFA and PUFA content, respectively.

18515829,The utilization and desaturation of oleate and linoleate during glycerolipid biosynthesis in olive (Olea europaea L.) callus cultures.,"Callus cultures from olive (Olea europaea L.) were used to study characteristics of desaturation in this oil-rich tissue. The incorporation of [1-(14)C]oleate and [1-(14)C]linoleate into complex lipids and their further desaturation was followed in incubations of up to 48 h. Both radiolabelled fatty acids were rapidly incorporated into lipids, especially phosphatidylcholine and triacylglycerol. Radiolabelling of these two lipids peaked after 1-4 h, after which it fell. In contrast, other phosphoglycerides and the galactosylglycerides were labelled in a more sustained manner. [1-(14)C]Linoleate was almost exclusively found in the galactolipids. With [1-(14)C]linoleate as a precursor, the only significant desaturation to linolenate was in the galactolipids. Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol was the first lipid in which [1-(14)C]linoleate and [1-(14)C]linolenate appeared after incubation of the calli with [1-(14)C]oleate and [1-(14)C]linoleate, respectively. The presence of radioactivity in the plastidial lipids shows that both [1-(14)C]oleate and [1-(14)C]linoleate can freely enter the chloroplast. Two important environmental effects were also examined. Raised incubation temperatures (30-35 degrees C) reduced oleate desaturation and this was also reflected in the endogenous fatty acid composition. Low light also caused less oleate desaturation. The data indicate that lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase is important for the entry of oleate and linoleate into olive callus lipid metabolism and phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase may be involved in triacylglycerol biosynthesis. In addition, it is shown that plastid desaturases are mainly responsible for the production of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Individual fatty acid desaturases were differently susceptible to environmental stresses with FAD2 being reduced by both high temperature and low light, whereas FAD7 was only affected by high temperature.",10.1093/jxb/ern121,True,high,True,high,"[""Olea europaea L.""]","[""fatty acid desaturation"", ""lipid biosynthesis"", ""chloroplast lipid metabolism""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Olea europaea L.""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""The incorporation of [1-(14)C]oleate and [1-(14)C]linoleate into complex lipids and their further desaturation was followed in incubations of up to 48 h."", ""Both radiolabelled fatty acids were rapidly incorporated into lipids, especially phosphatidylcholine and triacylglycerol.""], ""explanation"": ""The study tracks the uptake, incorporation, and subsequent desaturation of specific fatty acids ([1\u2011(14)C]oleate and [1\u2011(14)C]linoleate) into various lipid classes within olive callus cultures, thereby directly investigating fatty acid metabolism and lipid biosynthetic pathways."", ""specific_topics"": [""fatty acid desaturation"", ""lipid biosynthesis"", ""chloroplast lipid metabolism""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",1: Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways,success,1.0,Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways
28348403,Transcriptome and functional analysis reveals hybrid vigor for oil biosynthesis in oil palm.,"Oil palm is the most productive oil crop in the world and composes 36% of the world production. However, the molecular mechanisms of hybrids vigor (or heterosis) between Dura, Pisifera and their hybrid progeny Tenera has not yet been well understood. Here we compared the temporal and spatial compositions of lipids and transcriptomes for two oil yielding organs mesocarp and endosperm from Dura, Pisifera and Tenera. Multiple lipid biosynthesis pathways are highly enriched in all non-additive expression pattern in endosperm, while cytokinine biosynthesis and cell cycle pathways are highly enriched both in endosperm and mesocarp. Compared with parental palms, the high oil content in Tenera was associated with much higher transcript levels of EgWRI1, homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana WRINKLED1.

29943206,"SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 influences flowering time, lateral branching, oil quality, and seed yield in Brassica juncea cv. Varuna.","SOC1, a MADS-box type II transcription factor, integrates environmental and endogenous cues to promote flowering in angiosperms. Recent reports implicating SOC1 in roles beyond floral transition prompted functional characterization of SOC1 in polyploid rapeseed mustard genomes. Gene characterization in Brassicas necessitates analysis of composite homeolog function. While insertional mutagenesis is untenable in Brassicas owing to gene redundancy, gain-of-function approach entails serial characterization of individual homeologs. Herein, we demonstrate modulated floral promotive effects in natural variants of Brassica SOC1 and provide lateral branching as a probable outcome of polyploidy-induced gene diversification. Ectopic expression of two B genome specific SOC1 variants in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in differential floral acceleration and manifestation of multiple vegetative rosettes. Characterization of composite homeolog function in B. juncea via introgression of Brassica SOC1 specific artificial miRNA, designed to target homeologs, also exhibited modifications in floral transition and lateral branching. Comprehensive analysis of field performance of B. juncea transgenics displayed altered fitness across 11 agronomic traits. Crucially, reduced SOC1 levels directly impacted two developmental traits, namely, flowering time and number of lateral branches which in turn influenced several dependent agronomic traits. While delayed flowering and crop maturity resulted in altered fatty acid composition with higher SFA and lower PUFA in transgenics relative to controls, reduction in overall count of lateral branches caused a concomitant decrease in silique count which ultimately impacted total seed yield in transgenics. Statistical analysis revealed number of secondary branches as the most critical trait influencing seed yield. Based on our findings, we propose enhancing levels Brassica SOC1, a key target, for achieving earliness in flowering, improved seed yield and oil quality, and studying trait trade-offs.",10.1007/s10142-018-0626-8,True,high,True,high,"[""Brassica juncea""]","[""fatty acid composition"", ""lipid metabolism""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Brassica juncea""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""While delayed flowering and crop maturity resulted in altered fatty acid composition with higher SFA and lower PUFA in transgenics relative to controls,""], ""explanation"": ""The study reports changes in fatty acid composition\u2014specifically increased saturated fatty acids (SFA) and decreased polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)\u2014as a consequence of manipulating SOC1 expression, indicating direct investigation into lipid-related traits."", ""specific_topics"": [""fatty acid composition"", ""lipid metabolism""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",1: Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways,success,1.0,Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways

Pyruvate is a major source of carbon for <i>de novo</i> fatty acid biosynthesis in plastids, and the embryo's demand for pyruvate is reported to increase during active oil accumulation. In this study, we tested our hypothesis that oil biosynthesis could be boosted by increasing pyruvate flux into plastids.

The total seed number did not differ significantly between the WT and OEs. Therefore, oil yield per plant was increased by 24-43% in the OE lines compared to WT.

24398521,Fatty acid synthesis is inhibited by inefficient utilization of unusual fatty acids for glycerolipid assembly.,"Degradation of unusual fatty acids through β-oxidation within transgenic plants has long been hypothesized as a major factor limiting the production of industrially useful unusual fatty acids in seed oils. Arabidopsis seeds expressing the castor fatty acid hydroxylase accumulate hydroxylated fatty acids up to 17% of total fatty acids in seed triacylglycerols; however, total seed oil is also reduced up to 50%. Investigations into the cause of the reduced oil phenotype through in vivo [(14)C]acetate and [(3)H]2O metabolic labeling of developing seeds surprisingly revealed that the rate of de novo fatty acid synthesis within the transgenic seeds was approximately half that of control seeds. RNAseq analysis indicated no changes in expression of fatty acid synthesis genes in hydroxylase-expressing plants. However, differential [(14)C]acetate and [(14)C]malonate metabolic labeling of hydroxylase-expressing seeds indicated the in vivo acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity was reduced to approximately half that of control seeds. Therefore, the reduction of oil content in the transgenic seeds is consistent with reduced de novo fatty acid synthesis in the plastid rather than fatty acid degradation. Intriguingly, the coexpression of triacylglycerol synthesis isozymes from castor along with the fatty acid hydroxylase alleviated the reduced acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity, restored the rate of fatty acid synthesis, and the accumulation of seed oil was substantially recovered.

We mapped 11,074,508 and 11,495,788 paired-end reads from endosperm and embryo, respectively, at 9 d after pollination to define gene structure and alternative splicing events as well as transcriptional regulators of gene expression to quantify transcript abundance in both embryo and endosperm. We identified a large number of novel transcribed regions that did not fall within maize annotated regions, and many of the novel transcribed regions were tissue-specifically expressed. We found that 50.7% (8,556 of 16,878) of multiexonic genes were alternatively spliced, and some transcript isoforms were specifically expressed either in endosperm or in embryo. In addition, a total of 46 trans-splicing events, with nine intrachromosomal events and 37 interchromosomal events, were found in our data set. Many metabolic activities were specifically assigned to endosperm and embryo, such as starch biosynthesis in endosperm and lipid biosynthesis in embryo.

28818368,Review: Metabolic engineering of unusual lipids in the synthetic biology era.,"The plant kingdom produces a variety of fatty acid structures, many of which possess functional groups useful for industrial applications. The species that produce these unusual fatty acids are often not suitable for large scale commercial production. The ability to create genetically modified plants, together with emerging synthetic biology approaches, offers the potential to develop alternative oil seed crops capable of producing high levels of modified lipids. In some cases, by combining genes from different species, non-natural lipids with a targeted structure can be conceived. However, the expression of the biosynthetic enzymes responsible for the synthesis of unusual fatty acids typically results in poor accumulation of the desired product. An improved understanding of fatty acid flux from synthesis to storage revealed that specialized enzymes are needed to traffic unusual fatty acids. Co-expression of some of these additional enzymes has incrementally increased the levels of unusual fatty acids in transgenic seeds. Understanding how the introduced pathways interact with the endogenous pathways will be important for further enhancing the levels of unusual fatty acids in transgenic plants. Eliminating endogenous activities, as well as segregating the different pathways, represent strategies to further increase accumulation of unusual lipids.",10.1016/j.plantsci.2017.07.007,True,high,True,high,,"[""fatty acid metabolism"", ""lipid engineering"", ""synthetic biology""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": null, ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""The plant kingdom produces a variety of fatty acid structures, many of which possess functional groups useful for industrial applications."", ""Co\u2011expression of some of these additional enzymes has incrementally increased the levels of unusual fatty acids in transgenic seeds.""], ""explanation"": ""The study focuses on engineering and manipulating fatty acid biosynthesis pathways in plants, directly addressing lipid composition and accumulation."", ""specific_topics"": [""fatty acid metabolism"", ""lipid engineering"", ""synthetic biology""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",1: Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways,success,1.0,Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways

The transcription factor WAX INDUCER1/SHINE1 (WIN1/SHN1) regulates the biosynthesis of waxy substances in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we show that the MIXTA-like MYB transcription factors MYB106 and MYB16, which regulate epidermal cell morphology, also regulate cuticle development coordinately with WIN1/SHN1 in Arabidopsis and Torenia fournieri. Expression of a MYB106 chimeric repressor fusion (35S:MYB106-SRDX) and knockout/down of MYB106 and MYB16 induced cuticle deficiencies characterized by organ adhesion and reduction of epicuticular wax crystals and cutin nanoridges. A similar organ fusion phenotype was produced by expression of a WIN1/SHN1 chimeric repressor. Conversely, the dominant active form of MYB106 (35S:MYB106-VP16) induced ectopic production of cutin nanoridges and increased expression of WIN1/SHN1 and wax biosynthetic genes. Microarray experiments revealed that MYB106 and WIN1/SHN1 regulate similar sets of genes, predominantly those involved in wax and cutin biosynthesis. Furthermore, WIN1/SHN1 expression was induced by MYB106-VP16 and repressed by MYB106-SRDX.

Despite its current use as a source of biofuel, soybean oil contains an average of 25 % oleic acid and 13 % palmitic acid, which negatively impacts its oxidative stability and freezing point, causing a high rate of nitrogen oxide emission. Gas chromatography and ion mobility mass spectrometry were conducted on soybean fatty acids from metabolically engineered seed extracts to determine the nature of the structural oleic and palmitic acids. The soybean genes FAD2-1 and FatB were placed under the control of the 35SCaMV constitutive promoter, introduced to soybean embryonic axes by particle bombardment and down-regulated using RNA interference technology. Results indicate that the metabolically engineered plants exhibited a significant increase in oleic acid (up to 94.58 %) and a reduction in palmitic acid (to <3 %) in their seed oil content.

26965486,Wax and cutin mutants of Arabidopsis: Quantitative characterization of the cuticular transport barrier in relation to chemical composition.,"Using (14)C-labeled epoxiconazole as a tracer, cuticular permeability of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves was quantitatively measured in order to compare different wax and cutin mutants (wax2, cut1, cer5, att1, bdg, shn3 and shn1) to the corresponding wild types (Col-0 and Ws). Mutants were characterized by decreases or increases in wax and/or cutin amounts. Permeances [ms(-1)] of Arabidopsis cuticles either increased in the mutants compared to wild type or were not affected. Thus, genetic changes in wax and cutin biosynthesis in some of the investigated Arabidopsis mutants obviously impaired the coordinated cutin and wax deposition at the outer leaf epidermal cell wall. As a consequence, barrier properties of cuticles were significantly decreased. However, increasing cutin and wax amounts by genetic modifications, did not automatically lead to improved cuticular barrier properties. As an alternative approach to the radioactive transport assay, changes in chlorophyll fluorescence were monitored after foliar application of metribuzine, an herbicide inhibiting electron transport in chloroplasts. Since both, half-times of photosynthesis inhibition as well as times of complete inhibition, in fact correlated with (14)C-epoxiconazole permeances, different rates of decline of photosynthetic yield between mutants and wild type must be a function of foliar uptake of the herbicide across the cuticle. Thus, monitoring changes in chlorophyll fluorescence, instead of conducting radioactive transport assays, represents an easy-to-handle and fast alternative evaluating cuticular barrier properties of different genotypes.

22955034,Molecular cloning and functional analysis of two FAD2 genes from American grape (Vitis labrusca L.).,"The synthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), the most abundant fatty acids in plants, begins with a reaction catalyzed by fatty acid desaturase 2 (FAD2; EC 1.3.1.35), also called microsomal oleate Δ12-desaturase. Since the FAD2 gene was first identified in Arabidopsis thaliana, FAD2 research has gained wide interest as the essential enzyme for synthesizing PUFA. Grapes are one of the most frequently cultivated fruits in the world, with most commercial growers cultivating Vitis vinifera and V. labrusca. Grapeseed oil contains a high proportion, 60-70% of linoleic acid (18:2). We cloned two putative FAD2 genes from V. labrusca cv. Campbell Early based on V. vinifera genome sequences. Deduced amino acid sequences of two putative genes showed that VlFAD2s show high similarity to Arabidopsis FAD2 and commonly contain six transmembrane domain, three histidine boxes and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retrieval motif representing the characteristics of fatty acid desaturase. Phylogenetic analyses of various plant FAD2s showed that VlFAD2-1 and VlFAD2-2 are separately grouped with constitutive and seed-type FAD2s, respectively. Southern blot showed that one or two bands are found in each lane. Because Campbell Early is a hybrid cultivar, FAD2-1 and FAD2-2 genes may exist as one copy in V. labrusca. Expression analysis in different tissues indicated that VlFAD2-1 is a constitutive gene but VlFAD2-2 is a seed-type gene.

Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) combined with mass spectrometry (MS) analyses, 91 differentially accumulated protein (DAP) species that are related to fiber initiation were successfully identified, of which 58 preferentially accumulated in the wild-type and 33 species in the fl mutant. These DAPs are involved in various cellular and metabolic processes, mainly including important energy/carbohydrate metabolism, redox homeostasis, amino acid and fatty acid biosynthesis, protein quality control, cytoskeleton dynamics, and anthocyanidin metabolism. Further physiological and biochemical experiments revealed dynamic changes in the carbohydrate flux and H2O2 levels in the cotton fiber initiation process. Compared with those in the fl mutant, the contents of glucose and fructose in wild-type ovules sharply increased after anthesis with a relatively higher rate of amino acid biosynthesis. The relative sugar starvation and lower rate of amino acid biosynthesis in the fl mutant ovules may impede the carbohydrate/energy supply and cell wall synthesis, which is consistent with the proteomic results. However, the H2O2 burst was only observed in the wild-type ovules on the day of anthesis. Cotton boll injection experiments in combination with electron microscope observation collectively indicated that H2O2 burst, which is negatively regulated by ascorbate peroxidases (APx), plays an important role in the fiber initiation process.

17449808,The transcription factor WIN1/SHN1 regulates Cutin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"The composition and permeability of the cuticle has a large influence on its ability to protect the plant against various forms of biotic and abiotic stress. WAX INDUCER1 (WIN1) and related transcription factors have recently been shown to trigger wax production, enhance drought tolerance, and modulate cuticular permeability when overexpressed in Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that WIN1 influences the composition of cutin, a polyester that forms the backbone of the cuticle. WIN1 overexpression induces compositional changes and an overall increase in cutin production in vegetative and reproductive organs, while its downregulation has the opposite effect. Changes in cutin composition are preceded by the rapid and coordinated induction of several genes known or likely to be involved in cutin biosynthesis. This transcriptional response is followed after a delay by the induction of genes associated with wax biosynthesis, suggesting that the regulation of cutin and wax production by WIN1 is a two-step process.

20439099,Analysis of QTLs for erucic acid and oil content in seeds on A8 chromosome and the linkage drag between the alleles for the two traits in Brassica napus.,"The history of canola breeding began with the discovery of germplasm with low erucic acid content in seeds of spring forage cultivar in the 1950's. FAE1 mutations led to a dramatic decrease of the seed erucic acid content in Arabidopsis thaliana. The products of the two FAE1 loci, BnA8.FAE1 and BnC3.FAE1, showed additive effects to the level of erucic acid content in oilseed rape. Previous research believed that the pleiotropy of FAE1 was responsible for the decrease in seed oil content along with the reduction of seed erucic acid content in the modern cultivars. TN DH population was developed from a canola cultivar Tapidor and a Chinese traditional cultivar Ningyou7. The population had been tested in 10 and 11 environments to map QTLs for the erucic acid content and oil content in seeds. As the map resolution increased, a novel QTL for seed erucic acid content was revealed, after Meta-analysis, 7 cM away from the most significant seed erucic acid content QTL where BnA8.FAE1 is located. Seven independent QTLs for seed oil content (qOC) were detected around the two seed erucic acid content QTLs (qEA) across 39.20 cM on linkage group A8. Two of the qOCs co-localized with the two qEAs, respectively, and were detected in a single environment. The other five qOCs were detected in 10 of 11 environments independent of qEAs. Alleles from Tapidor in all the QTLs at the 0-39.20 cM region contributed negative effects to either erucic acid content or oil content in seeds. Parallel, genotyping showed that on 5 of the 7 QTLs regions, Tapidor alleles had the same genotypes with that in 'Liho', the original low seed erucic acid content source. Through rounds of crossbreeding with oil-cropped cultivars and intensive selection for multi generations, Tapidor still had the inferior alleles for low seed oil content from 'Liho', the forage rape.

25969557,Toward production of jet fuel functionality in oilseeds: identification of FatB acyl-acyl carrier protein thioesterases and evaluation of combinatorial expression strategies in Camelina seeds.,"Seeds of members of the genus Cuphea accumulate medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs; 8:0-14:0). MCFA- and palmitic acid- (16:0) rich vegetable oils have received attention for jet fuel production, given their similarity in chain length to Jet A fuel hydrocarbons. Studies were conducted to test genes, including those from Cuphea, for their ability to confer jet fuel-type fatty acid accumulation in seed oil of the emerging biofuel crop Camelina sativa. Transcriptomes from Cuphea viscosissima and Cuphea pulcherrima developing seeds that accumulate >90% of C8 and C10 fatty acids revealed three FatB cDNAs (CpuFatB3, CvFatB1, and CpuFatB4) expressed predominantly in seeds and structurally divergent from typical FatB thioesterases that release 16:0 from acyl carrier protein (ACP). Expression of CpuFatB3 and CvFatB1 resulted in Camelina oil with capric acid (10:0), and CpuFatB4 expression conferred myristic acid (14:0) production and increased 16:0. Co-expression of combinations of previously characterized Cuphea and California bay FatBs produced Camelina oils with mixtures of C8-C16 fatty acids, but amounts of each fatty acid were less than obtained by expression of individual FatB cDNAs. Increases in lauric acid (12:0) and 14:0, but not 10:0, in Camelina oil and at the sn-2 position of triacylglycerols resulted from inclusion of a coconut lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase specialized for MCFAs. RNA interference (RNAi) suppression of Camelina β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II, however, reduced 12:0 in seeds expressing a 12:0-ACP-specific FatB.

25336520,Natural variation in sensitivity to a loss of chloroplast translation in Arabidopsis.,"Mutations that eliminate chloroplast translation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) result in embryo lethality. The stage of embryo arrest, however, can be influenced by genetic background. To identify genes responsible for improved growth in the absence of chloroplast translation, we examined seedling responses of different Arabidopsis accessions on spectinomycin, an inhibitor of chloroplast translation, and crossed the most tolerant accessions with embryo-defective mutants disrupted in chloroplast ribosomal proteins generated in a sensitive background. The results indicate that tolerance is mediated by ACC2, a duplicated nuclear gene that targets homomeric acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase to plastids, where the multidomain protein can participate in fatty acid biosynthesis. In the presence of functional ACC2, tolerance is enhanced by a second locus that maps to chromosome 5 and heightened by additional genetic modifiers present in the most tolerant accessions. Notably, some of the most sensitive accessions contain nonsense mutations in ACC2, including the ""Nossen"" line used to generate several of the mutants studied here. Functional ACC2 protein is therefore not required for survival in natural environments, where heteromeric acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase encoded in part by the chloroplast genome can function instead. This work highlights an interesting example of a tandem gene duplication in Arabidopsis, helps to explain the range of embryo phenotypes found in Arabidopsis mutants disrupted in essential chloroplast functions, addresses the nature of essential proteins encoded by the chloroplast genome, and underscores the value of using natural variation to study the relationship between chloroplast translation, plant metabolism, protein import, and plant development.",10.1104/pp.114.249052,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""acetyl\u2011CoA carboxylase"", ""fatty acid biosynthesis"", ""chloroplast translation""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""The results indicate that tolerance is mediated by ACC2, a duplicated nuclear gene that targets homomeric acetyl\u2011coenzyme A carboxylase to plastids, where the multidomain protein can participate in fatty acid biosynthesis.""], ""explanation"": ""The study identifies ACC2 as mediating tolerance via its role in fatty acid biosynthesis within plastids, linking chloroplast translation to lipid metabolic pathways."", ""specific_topics"": [""acetyl\u2011CoA carboxylase"", ""fatty acid biosynthesis"", ""chloroplast translation""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",1: Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways,success,1.0,Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways

To study its mode of action, we performed a phenotypic screening of NJ15-low-sensitive lines among mutant pools of Arabidopsis. One line (f127) showed clear NJ15-low-sensitivity in terms of hypocotyl elongation and shoot gravitropism. After further testing, it was determined that DCR, an enzyme involved in cutin polymerization, had lost its function in the mutant, which caused its low sensitivity to NJ15. Fatty acids are the base materials for polymers such as cutin and cuticular wax. We confirmed that NJ15 affects fatty acid biosynthesis, and that it does differently from cafenstrole, a known inhibitor of cuticular wax formation. Based on these results, we propose that the target of NJ15 is likely located within the cutin polymer formation pathway.

All three BnGPAT4 isoforms exhibited sn-2 acyltransferase and phosphatase activities with dicarboxylic acid-CoA as acyl donor. When non-substituted acyl-CoA was used as acyl donor, the rate of acylation was considerably lower and phosphatase activity was not manifested.

Microscopic examination and reciprocal crosses revealed that both pollen grains and developing embryo sacs of the B. napus gpat4 lines were affected. The gpat4 mature embryos showed decreased cutin content and altered monomer composition. The defective embryo development further affected the oil body morphology, oil content, and fatty acid composition in gpat4 seeds.

The GFP-OsOPR7 fusion protein was detected exclusively in peroxisomes in onion epidermal cells. Furthermore, complementation analysis using an Arabidopsis opr3 mutant indicated that the OsOPR7 gene, but not OsOPR1, was able to complement the phenotypes of male sterility in the mutant caused by JA deficiency, and that JA production in the opr3 mutant was also restored by the expression of the OsOPR7 gene.

10859180,The role of pyruvate dehydrogenase and acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase in fatty acid synthesis in developing Arabidopsis seeds.,"Acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) formed within the plastid is the precursor for the biosynthesis of fatty acids and, through them, a range of important biomolecules. The source of acetyl-CoA in the plastid is not known, but two enzymes are thought to be involved: acetyl-CoA synthetase and plastidic pyruvate dehydrogenase. To determine the importance of these two enzymes in synthesizing acetyl-CoA during lipid accumulation in developing Arabidopsis seeds, we isolated cDNA clones for acetyl-CoA synthetase and for the ptE1alpha- and ptE1beta-subunits of plastidic pyruvate dehydrogenase. To our knowledge, this is the first reported acetyl-CoA synthetase sequence from a plant source. The Arabidopsis acetyl-CoA synthetase preprotein has a calculated mass of 76,678 D, an apparent plastid targeting sequence, and the mature protein is a monomer of 70 to 72 kD. During silique development, the spatial and temporal patterns of the ptE1beta mRNA level are very similar to those of the mRNAs for the plastidic heteromeric acetyl-CoA carboxylase subunits. The pattern of ptE1beta mRNA accumulation strongly correlates with the formation of lipid within the developing embryo.

Biochemical analysis of T(2) and T(3) A. thaliana seeds revealed a significant increase in polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs) (18:2(cisDelta9,12) and 18:3(cisDelta9,12,15)) at the expense of very long monounsaturated FA (20:1(cisDelta11)) and saturated FAs. In vitro assays demonstrated that recombinant B. napus ACBP (rBnACBP) strongly increases the formation of phosphatidylcholine (PC) in the absence of added lysophosphatidylcholine in microsomes from DeltaYOR175c yeast expressing A. thaliana lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (AthLPCAT) cDNA or in microsomes from microspore-derived cell suspension cultures of B. napus L. cv.

These data suggest that the cytosolic 10-kDa ACBP has an effect on the equilibrium between metabolically active acyl pools (acyl-CoA and phospholipid pools) involved in FA modifications and triacylglycerol bioassembly in plants.

22028775,A J-like protein influences fatty acid composition of chloroplast lipids in Arabidopsis.,"A comprehensive understanding of the lipid and fatty acid metabolic machinery is needed for optimizing production of oils and fatty acids for fuel, industrial feedstocks and nutritional improvement in plants. T-DNA mutants in the poorly annotated Arabidopsis thaliana gene At1g08640 were identified as containing moderately high levels (50-100%) of 16∶1Δ7 and 18∶1Δ9 leaf fatty acids and subtle decreases (5-30%) of 16∶3 and 18∶3 (http://www.plastid.msu.edu/). TLC separation of fatty acids in the leaf polar lipids revealed that the chloroplastic galactolipids monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) were the main lipid types affected by this mutation. Analysis of the inferred amino acid sequence of At1g08640 predicted the presence of a transit peptide, three transmembrane domains and an N-terminal J-like domain, and the gene was named CJD1 for Chloroplast J-like Domain 1. GFP reporter experiments and in vitro chloroplast import assays demonstrated CJD1 is a chloroplast membrane protein. Screening of an Arabidopsis cDNA library by yeast-2-hybrid (Y2H) using the J-like domain of CJD1 as bait identified a plastidial inner envelope protein (Accumulation and Replication of Chloroplasts 6, ARC6) as the primary interacting partner in the Y2H assay. ARC6 plays a central role in chloroplast division and binds CJD1 via its own J-like domain along with an adjacent conserved region whose function is not fully known.

9680976,A bifunctional oleate 12-hydroxylase: desaturase from Lesquerella fendleri.,"LFAH12, an oleate 12-hydroxylase gene from Lesquerella fendleri (L.) was isolated on the basis of nucleotide sequence similarity to an oleate hydroxylase gene from Ricinus communis (L.). Transgenic Arabidopsis plants containing the Lesquerella gene under transcriptional control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter accumulated ricinoleic, lesquerolic and densipolic acids in seeds, but not in leaves or roots. However, hydroxylase activity was detectable in crude extracts of vegetative tissues. The discrepancy between the presence of activity and the lack of hydroxy fatty acids suggests selective removal and breakdown of hydroxy fatty acids in vegetative organs. High levels of LFAH12 mRNA accumulation did not lead to correspondingly high levels of protein accumulation, suggesting that accumulation of the hydroxylase may be controlled post-transcriptionally. Expression of the L. fendleri gene in transgenic plants of a fad2 mutant of Arabidopsis, which is deficient in cytoplasmic oleate delta 12 desaturase activity, resulted in partial suppression of the mutant phenotype in roots. Thus, unlike the hydroxylase from R. communis, the L. fendleri enzyme has both hydroxylase and desaturase activities.

41043409,BnaC04.bZIP16 can be phosphorylated and inhibited by BnaA06.SnRK2 and negatively regulates the accumulation of fatty acids in Brassica napus.,"Brassica napus is an important oil crop with a significant amount of fatty acid in its seeds. However, the molecular mechanisms of fatty acid synthesis and accumulation are still poorly understood. In this study, we identified a transcription factor, BnaC04.bZIP16, which belongs to the G subfamily of the bZIP family, that negatively regulates the accumulation of fatty acid in B. napus. BnaC04.bZIP16 directly binds to the promoters of BnaA08.OLEOSIN1 and BnaC03.PDH-E1 BETA to regulate seed fatty acid content. Furthermore, BnaC04.bZIP16 can be phosphorylated by the BnaA06.SnRK2. BnaA06.SnRK2-dependent phosphorylation can weaken BnaC04.bZIP16 protein stability as well as the DNA-binding ability. Interestingly, overexpression of BnaA06.SnRK2 can significantly promote the accumulation of fatty acid.

Furthermore, we demonstrated that the wheat enoyl-CoA reductase promoter-binding MYB transcription factor 1 (TaEPBM1)could directly target TaCER3 genes and recruit components of the SAGA histone acetyltransferase complex to mediate histone acetylation, thereby stimulating TaCER3 transcription and potentiating wax biosynthesis. Wheat RNA processing machineries, including the RNA exosome, SUPERKILLER complex, cap-binding complex (CBC) components, TaSERRATE, and its partners, as well as elongator subunits, affected the accumulation of TaCER3 transcripts and controlled wax biosynthesis. Silencing of wheat CBC components, TaSERRATE, and elongator subunits resulted in the accumulation of TaCER3 transcripts and increased wax biosynthesis. Importantly, the activation of wheat wax biosynthesis in the absence of RNA processing factors was suppressed by silencing TaCER3 expression.

Under seed-specific overexpression of ZmSAD1 in Arabidopsis, the stearic acid content and the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in the seeds were significantly decreased relative to those in the control. Conversely, in transgenic ZmSAD1 RNAi Arabidopsis seeds, the contents of stearic acid and long-chain saturated acids and the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids were significantly increased; in addition, the oleic acid content was significantly decreased. More importantly, transgenic ZmSAD1 maize that expressed high levels of ZmSAD1 in its mature seeds showed reduced stearic acid content (1.57 %) and a lower saturated to unsaturated fatty acid ratio (20.40 %) relative to those (1.64 % and 20.61 %, respectively) of the control. Conversely, down-regulation of ZmSAD1 in maize resulted in increased levels of stearic acid (1.78 %), long-chain saturated acids (0.85 %) and the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids (21.54 %) relative to those (1.64 %, 0.74 %, and 20.61 %, respectively) of the control, whereas the oleic acid (32.01 %) level was significantly decreased relative to that (32.68 %) of the control. Our work demonstrates that the contents of stearic acid, oleic acid, and long-chain saturated acids, and the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids, are modified in maize seeds by seed-specific overexpression or down-regulation of ZmSAD1. Therefore, the ZmSAD1 gene is a useful tool for engineering the seed oil composition in maize and other crops.",10.1186/s12870-016-0827-z,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis"", ""maize""]","[""fatty acid composition"", ""seed oil biosynthesis"", ""enzyme activity""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis"", ""maize""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Stearoyl\u2011acyl carrier protein desaturase (SAD) is a key enzyme that catalyses the conversion of stearoyl\u2011acyl carrier protein (ACP) to oleoyl\u2011ACP, a precursor for the biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids."", ""Under seed\u2011specific overexpression of ZmSAD1 in Arabidopsis, the stearic acid content and the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in the seeds were significantly decreased relative to those in the control.""], ""explanation"": ""The study focuses on modifying fatty acid composition in seeds through genetic manipulation of a desaturase enzyme, directly addressing lipid metabolism and fatty acid profiles."", ""specific_topics"": [""fatty acid composition"", ""seed oil biosynthesis"", ""enzyme activity""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",1: Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways,success,1.0,Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways

9681004,A Cuphea beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase shifts the synthesis of fatty acids towards shorter chains in Arabidopsis seeds expressing Cuphea FatB thioesterases.,"Acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) thioesterases with specificities on medium chain substrates (C8-C14) are requisite enzymes in plants that produce 8:0, 10:0, 12:0 and 14:0 seed oils, but they may not be the sole enzymatic determinants of chain length. The contribution to chain length regulation of a beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase, Cw KAS A1, derived from Cuphea wrightii, a species that accumulates 30% 10:0 and 54% 12:0 in seed oils, was investigated. Expression of Cw KAS A1 in Arabidopsis seeds reduced 16:0 from 8.2 to 6.2 mol%, suggesting a KAS II-type activity. In the presence of the KAS I inhibitor cerulenin, however, transgenic seed extracts extended 6:0- and 8:0-ACP at a rate four- to fivefold greater than extracts from untransformed plants, whereas no difference was observed in extension of 14:0- and 16:0-ACP. The effect of KAS A1 on seed oils was tested by combining it with the C. wrightii medium chain-specific thioesterases, Cw FatB1 and Cw FatB2, in crosses of transformed plants. Fatty acid synthesis thesis shifted towards shorter chains in progeny expressing both classes of enzymes. KasA1/FatB1 homozygotes produced threefold more 12:0 than the FatB1 parent while 14:0 and 16:0 were reduced by one-third and one-half, respectively. F2 progeny expressing KasA1 and FatB2 produced twofold more 10:0 and 1.4-fold more 12:0 than the FatB2 parent, and the double-transgenic progeny produced one-quarter less 14:0 and one-half less 16:0 than the FatB2 parent.

To gain an understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the reaction catalyzed by DPW, the gene encoding DPW without the N-terminal 80 amino acids (DPWΔ80) was cloned into pET-28a vector and was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. DPWΔ80 was purified to homogeneity and screened for crystallization. DPWΔ80 in complex with NADPH produced crystals that diffracted X-rays to a resolution of 3.4 Å.

The anther cuticle is composed of wax and cutin, the pollen wall includes exine and intine, and the components of the outer exine are collectively called sporopollenin. Other than cuticle wax, cutin and sporopollenin are biopolymers compounds. The precise constituents and developmental mechanism of these biopolymeric are poorly understood. Here, we reported a complete male sterile mutant, male sterile6021, in maize. The mutant displayed a smooth anther surface and irregular pollen wall formation before anthesis, and its tapetum was degraded immaturely. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed a severe reduction of lipid derivatives in the mutant anther. We cloned the gene by map based cloning. It encoded a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase that was localized in plastids. Expression analysis indicated that MS6021 was mainly expressed in the tapetum and microspore after the microspore was released from the tetrad. Functional complementation of the orthologous Arabidopsis mutant demonstrated that MS6021 is conserved between monocots and dicots and potentially even in flowering plants.

22942388,Altered starch turnover in the maternal plant has major effects on Arabidopsis fruit growth and seed composition.,"Mature seeds of both the high-starch starch-excess1 (sex1) mutant and the almost starchless phosphoglucomutase1 mutant of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) have 30% to 40% less lipid than seeds of wild-type plants. We show that this is a maternal effect and is not attributable to the defects in starch metabolism in the embryo itself. Low lipid contents and consequent slow postgerminative growth are seen only in mutant embryos that develop on maternal plants with mutant phenotypes. Mutant embryos that develop on plants with wild-type starch metabolism have wild-type lipid contents and postgerminative growth. The maternal effect on seed lipid content is attributable to carbohydrate starvation in the mutant fruit at night. Fruits on sex1 plants grow more slowly than those on wild-type plants, particularly at night, and have low sugars and elevated expression of starvation genes at night. Transcript levels of the transcription factor WRINKLED1, implicated in lipid synthesis, are reduced at night in sex1 but not in wild-type seeds, and so are transcript levels of key enzymes of glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis. sex1 embryos develop more slowly than wild-type embryos. We conclude that the reduced capacity of mutant plants to convert starch to sugars in leaves at night results in low nighttime carbohydrate availability in the developing fruit. This in turn reduces the rate of development and expression of genes encoding enzymes of storage product accumulation in the embryo. Thus, the supply of carbohydrate from the maternal plant to the developing fruit at night can have an important influence on oilseed composition and on postgerminative growth.",10.1104/pp.112.205062,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""lipid biosynthesis"", ""fatty acid synthesis"", ""maternal effect on seed lipid composition""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Mature seeds of both the high-starch starch-excess1 (sex1) mutant and the almost starchless phosphoglucomutase1 mutant of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) have 30% to 40% less lipid than seeds of wild-type plants."", ""Transcript levels of the transcription factor WRINKLED1, implicated in lipid synthesis, are reduced at night in sex1 but not in wild-type seeds, and so are transcript levels of key enzymes of glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis.""], ""explanation"": ""The study directly measures seed lipid content differences between mutants and wild type, discusses the role of the WRINKLED1 transcription factor in lipid synthesis, and examines how changes in carbohydrate metabolism affect fatty acid synthesis pathways, indicating a clear focus on lipid biochemistry."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid biosynthesis"", ""fatty acid synthesis"", ""maternal effect on seed lipid composition""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",1: Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways,success,1.0,Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways

Heterologous expression of the three TaFARs in wild-type yeast and mutated yeast showed that TaFAR2, TaFAR3 and TaFAR4 were predominantly responsible for the accumulation of C18:0, C28:0 and C24:0 primary alcohols, respectively. Transgenic expression of the three TaFARs in tomato fruit and Arabidopsis cer4 mutant led to increased production of C22:0-C30:0 primary alcohols. GFP-fusion protein injection assay showed that the three encoded TaFAR proteins were localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the site of wax biosynthesis. The transcriptional expression of the three TaFAR genes was induced by cold, salt, drought and ABA.

12805604,Expression of antisense acyl carrier protein-4 reduces lipid content in Arabidopsis leaf tissue.,"Arabidopsis plants were transformed with acyl carrier protein (ACP)-4 in antisense conformation driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. It was hypothesized that reduction of ACP4 in leaf tissue would result in a reduction in lipid biosynthesis and, in addition, affect fatty acid composition and leaf physiology. Several transgenic lines have been generated with reduced ACP4 protein in leaf tissue. Dramatic reductions in ACP4 resulted in a reduction of leaf lipid content (22%-60%) based on fresh leaf weight and a bleached appearance and reduced photosynthetic efficiency. In addition, a decrease in 16:3 as a percentage of the total fatty acid composition was noted. There were no changes in leaf lipid class distribution; however, there was a decrease in the relative amount of 16:3 in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol. These results suggest that ACP4 plays a major role in the biosynthesis of fatty acids for chloroplast membrane development. Alterations in the ACP isoform profile of Arabidopsis leaf also appear to alter the flow of fatty acids between the prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathways for assembly of galactolipids. However, it has not yet been determined if the changes in fatty acid composition are due to changes in the profile of ACP isoforms, or if they are actually a reaction to a reduction in fatty acid precursors.",10.1104/pp.102.018622,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis""]","[""fatty acid biosynthesis"", ""leaf lipid content"", ""galactolipid assembly""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""It was hypothesized that reduction of ACP4 in leaf tissue would result in a reduction in lipid biosynthesis and, in addition, affect fatty acid composition and leaf physiology."", ""Dramatic reductions in ACP4 resulted in a reduction of leaf lipid content (22%-60%) based on fresh leaf weight and a bleached appearance and reduced photosynthetic efficiency.""], ""explanation"": ""The study directly examines how altering acyl carrier protein-4 expression affects lipid biosynthesis, fatty acid composition, and overall leaf lipid content in Arabidopsis, indicating a clear focus on lipid metabolism."", ""specific_topics"": [""fatty acid biosynthesis"", ""leaf lipid content"", ""galactolipid assembly""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",1: Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways,success,1.0,Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Pathways

Besides photorespiration and lipid metabolism, plant peroxisomes play a key role in many metabolic and signaling pathways, such as biosynthesis of phytohormones, pathogen defense, senescence-associated processes, biosynthesis of biotin and isoprenoids, and metabolism of urate, polyamines, sulfite, phylloquinone, volatile benzenoids, and branched chain amino acids. These peroxisomal pathways require an interplay with other cellular compartments, including plastids, mitochondria, and the cytosol. Consequently, a considerable number of substrates, intermediates, end products, and cofactors have to shuttle across peroxisome membranes. However, our knowledge of their membrane passage is still quite limited. This review describes the solute transport processes required to connect peroxisomes with other cell compartments.

21628525,A member of the PLEIOTROPIC DRUG RESISTANCE family of ATP binding cassette transporters is required for the formation of a functional cuticle in Arabidopsis.,"Although the multilayered structure of the plant cuticle was discovered many years ago, the molecular basis of its formation and the functional relevance of the layers are not understood. Here, we present the permeable cuticle1 (pec1) mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, which displays features associated with a highly permeable cuticle in several organs. In pec1 flowers, typical cutin monomers, such as ω-hydroxylated fatty acids and 10,16-dihydroxypalmitate, are reduced to 40% of wild-type levels and are accompanied by the appearance of lipidic inclusions within the epidermal cell. The cuticular layer of the cell wall, rather than the cuticle proper, is structurally altered in pec1 petals. Therefore, a significant role for the formation of the diffusion barrier in petals can be attributed to this layer. Thus, pec1 defines a new class of mutants. The phenotypes of the pec1 mutant are caused by the knockout of ATP BINDING CASSETTEG32 (ABCG32), an ABC transporter from the PLEIOTROPIC DRUG RESISTANCE family that is localized at the plasma membrane of epidermal cells in a polar manner toward the surface of the organs.

Here, seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. were germinated in, and seedlings maintained on, micromolar concentrations of N-lauroylethanolamine (NAE 12:0). NAE 12:0 inhibited root elongation, increased radial swelling of root tips, and reduced root hair numbers in a highly selective and concentration-dependent manner. These effects were reversible when seedlings were transferred to NAE-free medium. Older seedlings (14 days old) acclimated to exogenous NAE by increased formation of lateral roots, and generally, these lateral roots did not exhibit the severe symptoms observed in primary roots. Cells of NAE-treated primary roots were swollen and irregular in shape, and in many cases showed evidence, at the light- and electron-microscope levels, of improper cell wall formation. Microtubule arrangement was disrupted in severely distorted cells close to the root tip, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized green fluorescent protein (mGFP5-ER) was more abundant, aggregated and distributed differently in NAE-treated root cells, suggesting disruption of proper cell division, endomembrane organization and vesicle trafficking. These results suggest that NAE 12:0 likely influences normal cell expansion in roots by interfering with intracellular membrane trafficking to and/or from the cell surface.

9299788,Cadmium leads to stimulated expression of the lipid transfer protein genes in barley: implications for the involvement of lipid transfer proteins in wax assembly.,"In order to investigate the nature of genes expressed in leaf epidermal cells of higher plants, we have identified the nucleotide sequence of a cDNA designated ltp 7a2b encoding a novel nonspecific lipid transfer protein of barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Gerbel). The cDNA of 755 basepairs contains an open reading frame of 366 nucleotides coding for a 12.3-kDa polypeptide. The first 29 amino acids constitute the putative signal peptide, characteristic for targeting to the secretory pathway. Analysis of mRNA levels by Northern blotting indicated that ltp 7a2b is preferentially expressed in the leaf epidermis. Levels of mRNA decreased during ageing of leaf tissue. Expression of ltp 7a2b was stimulated by a factor of 2 - 3 when the seedlings were grown in the presence of cadmium (10 - 1600 microM).

41027006,Arabidopsis lipid kinase FAB1 regulates lateral root emergence via clathrin-mediated endocytosis of PIN-FORMED 3.,"Lateral root (LR) growth enables plants to explore regions of the soil, anchor themselves, and optimize nutrient and water uptake. LR development is characterized by the establishment of an auxin maximum at the lateral root primordium (LRP); however, the regulatory mechanisms underlying this process remain poorly understood. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), FORMATION OF APLOID AND BINUCLEATE CELLS1 (FAB1) encodes a lipid kinase responsible for biosynthesizing phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate. Our findings show that auxin induces FAB1 expression through AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR7/19 (ARF7/19). In turn, FAB1 modulates the auxin maximum at the LRP tip by regulating clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux carriers, forming a previously uncharacterized auxin-induced feedback loop during LR development. Loss of FAB1 function markedly increases LR number, while FAB1 overexpression suppresses LR formation. Diminished FAB1 activity leads to less clathrin accumulation at the plasma membrane (PM), limited endocytosis, and greater PIN3 retention at the LRP PM, thereby enhancing auxin flow toward LRP tips and promoting emergence.

4051498,Low-temperature-induced changes in intracellular fatty acid fluxes in Dunaliella salina.,"Two-minute exposures to exogenous [14C]palmitic, [14C]oleic, or [14C]lauric acid differentially labeled the lipids of Dunaliella salina microsomes and chloroplasts. Changes in fatty acid desaturation and intracellular movement during a subsequent 16-h incubation in nonradioactive medium indicated a slow transfer of lipids into the chloroplast from other organelles.

1955468,Acquisition of membrane lipids by differentiating glyoxysomes: role of lipid bodies.,"Glyoxysomes in cotyledons of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum, L.) seedlings enlarge dramatically within 48 h after seed imbibition (Kunce, C.M., R.N. Trelease, and D.C. Doman. 1984. Planta (Berl.). 161:156-164) to effect mobilization of stored cotton-seed oil. We discovered that the membranes of enlarging glyoxysomes at all stages examined contained a large percentage (36-62% by weight) of nonpolar lipid, nearly all of which were triacylglycerols (TAGs) and TAG metabolites. Free fatty acids comprised the largest percentage of these nonpolar lipids. Six uncommon (and as yet unidentified) fatty acids constituted the majority (51%) of both the free fatty acids and the fatty acids in TAGs of glyoxysome membranes; the same six uncommon fatty acids were less than 7% of the acyl constituents in TAGs extracted from cotton-seed storage lipid bodies. TAGs of lipid bodies primarily were composed of palmitic, oleic, and linoleic acids (together 70%). Together, these three major storage fatty acids were less than 10% of both the free fatty acids and fatty acids in TAGs of glyoxysome membranes. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) constituted a major portion of glyoxysome membrane phospholipids (together 61% by weight). Pulse-chase radiolabeling experiments in vivo clearly demonstrated that 14C-PC and 14C-PE were synthesized from 14C-choline and 14C-ethanolamine, respectively, in ER of cotyledons, and then transported to mitochondria; however, these lipids were not transported to enlarging glyoxysomes. The lack of ER involvement in glyoxysome membrane phospholipid synthesis, and the similarities in lipid compositions between lipid bodies and membranes of glyoxysomes, led us to formulate and test a new hypothesis whereby lipid bodies serve as the dynamic source of nonpolar lipids and phospholipids for membrane expansion of enlarging glyoxysomes. In a cell-free system, 3H-triolein (TO) and 3H-PC were indeed transferred from lipid bodies to glyoxysomes. 3H-PC, but not 3H-TO, also was transferred to mitochondria in vitro. The amount of lipid transferred increased linearly with respect to time and amount of acceptor organelle protein, and transfer occurred only when lipid body membrane proteins were associated with the donor lipid bodies. 3H-TO was transferred to and incorporated into glyoxysome membranes, and then hydrolyzed to free fatty acids. 3H-PC was transferred to and incorporated into glyoxysome and mitochondria membranes without subsequent hydrolysis. Our data are inconsistent with the hypothesis that ER contributes membrane lipids to glyoxysomes during postgerminative seedling growth.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",10.1083/jcb.115.4.995,True,high,True,high,"[""Gossypium hirsutum""]","[""triacylglycerols"", ""free fatty acids"", ""phosphatidylcholine"", ""lipid transport""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Gossypium hirsutum""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""The membranes of enlarging glyoxysomes at all stages examined contained a large percentage (36-62% by weight) of nonpolar lipid, nearly all of which were triacylglycerols (TAGs) and TAG metabolites."", ""Free fatty acids comprised the largest percentage of these nonpolar lipids.""], ""explanation"": ""The study characterizes the composition of glyoxysomal membranes, quantifying triacylglycerols, free fatty acids, and phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, and examines their transfer from lipid bodies, directly addressing fatty acid and lipid metabolism."", ""specific_topics"": [""triacylglycerols"", ""free fatty acids"", ""phosphatidylcholine"", ""lipid transport""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",2: Lipid Transport & Trafficking,success,2.0,Lipid Transport & Trafficking

19825596,Overexpression of Arabidopsis sorting nexin AtSNX2b inhibits endocytic trafficking to the vacuole.,"Sorting nexins are conserved proteins that function in vesicular trafficking and contain a characteristic phox homology (PX) domain. Here, we characterize the ubiquitously expressed Arabidopsis thaliana sorting nexin AtSNX2b. Sub-cellular fractionation studies indicate that AtSNX2b is peripherally associated with membranes. The AtSNX2b PX domain binds to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate in vitro and this association is required for the localization of GFP-AtSNX2b to punctate structures in vivo, identified as the trans-Golgi network, prevacuolar compartment and endosomes. Overexpression of GFP-tagged AtSNX2b produces enlarged GFP-labeled compartments that can also be labeled by the endocytic tracer FM4-64. Endocytic trafficking of FM4-64 to the vacuole is arrested in these GFP-AtSNX2b compartments, and similar FM4-64-accumulating compartments are seen upon overexpression of untagged AtSNX2b. This suggests that exit of membrane components from these enlarged or aggregated endosomes is inhibited. Vacuolar proteins containing an N-terminal propeptide, but not those with a C-terminal propeptide, are also present in these enlarged compartments.

22805434,Tomato GDSL1 is required for cutin deposition in the fruit cuticle.,"The plant cuticle consists of cutin, a polyester of glycerol, hydroxyl, and epoxy fatty acids, covered and filled by waxes. While the biosynthesis of cutin building blocks is well documented, the mechanisms underlining their extracellular deposition remain unknown. Among the proteins extracted from dewaxed tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) peels, we identified GDSL1, a member of the GDSL esterase/acylhydrolase family of plant proteins. GDSL1 is strongly expressed in the epidermis of growing fruit. In GDSL1-silenced tomato lines, we observed a significant reduction in fruit cuticle thickness and a decrease in cutin monomer content proportional to the level of GDSL1 silencing. A significant decrease of wax load was observed only for cuticles of the severely silenced transgenic line. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis of isolated cutins revealed a reduction in cutin density in silenced lines. Indeed, FTIR-attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy imaging showed that drastic GDSL1 silencing leads to a reduction in ester bond cross-links and to the appearance of nanopores in tomato cutins. Furthermore, immunolabeling experiments attested that GDSL1 is essentially entrapped in the cuticle proper and cuticle layer.

21691764,Misregulation of phosphoinositides in Arabidopsis thaliana decreases pollen hydration and maternal fertility.,"Phosphoinositides are important lipids involved in membrane identity, vesicle trafficking, and intracellular signaling. In recent years, phosphoinositides have been shown to play a critical role in polarized secretion in plants, as perturbations of phosphoinositide metabolism, through loss of function mutants, result in defects in root hair elongation and pollen tube growth, where polarized secretion occurs rapidly. In the Brassicaceae, responses of stigmatic papillae to compatible pollen are also thought to involve highly regulated secretory events to facilitate pollen hydration and penetration of the pollen tube through the stigmatic surface. We therefore sought to analyze the female sporophyte fertility of the root hair defective4-1 mutant and the PI 4-kinase β1/β2 double mutant, which differentially affect phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) levels. Stigmas from both mutants supported slower rates of pollen grain hydration, and the fecundity of these mutants was also diminished as a result of failed pollination events.

24598432,Autophagosome biogenesis in plants: roles of SH3P2.,"The autophagy core machinery is essentially conserved in eukaryotic cells for autophagy regulation. However, the underlying mechanisms for autophagosome formation in plant cells remain elusive. We have recently demonstrated that SH3 domain-containing protein 2 (SH3P2), a BAR (Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs) domain protein, functions as a novel regulator for autophagosome biogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. Using SH3P2 and its GFP fusion as probes, we have characterized the dynamics and structures of autophagosome formation in plant cells.

29987722,Analysis of the MTL Supercomplex at Contact Sites Between Mitochondria and Plastids.,"Plastids are organelles playing fundamental roles in different cellular processes such as energy metabolism or lipid biosynthesis. To fulfill their biogenesis and their function in the cell, plastids have to communicate with other cellular compartments. This communication can be mediated by the establishment of direct contact sites between plastids envelop and other organelles. These contacts are dynamic structures that are modified in response to stress. As example, during phosphate (Pi) starvation, the number of contact sites between plastids and mitochondria significantly increases. In this situation, these contacts play an important role in the transfer of galactoglycerolipids from plastids to mitochondria. Recently, Pi starvation stress was used to identify key proteins involved in the traffic of galactoglycerolipids from plastids to mitochondria in Arabidopsis thaliana. A mitochondrial lipoprotein complex called MTL (mitochondrial transmembrane lipoprotein complex) was identified. This complex contains mitochondrial proteins but also proteins located in the plastid envelope, suggesting its presence at the plastid-mitochondria junction. This chapter describes the protocol to isolate the MTL complex by clear-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (CN-PAGE) from the mitochondrial fraction of Arabidopsis cell cultures and the methods to study different features of this complex.",10.1007/978-1-4939-8654-5_12,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""galactoglycerolipids transfer"", ""MTL complex"", ""lipid biosynthesis""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Plastids are organelles playing fundamental roles in different cellular processes such as energy metabolism or lipid biosynthesis."", ""During phosphate (Pi) starvation, the number of contact sites between plastids and mitochondria significantly increases.

The deduced amino acid sequence of the GL1 and EPI23 proteins are very similar to each other and to two other plant proteins in which the sequences were deduced from their respective mRNAs. These are the Arabidopsis CER1 protein, which is involved in cuticular wax deposition on siliques, stems, and leaves of that plant, and the protein coded by the rice expressed sequence tag RICS2751A. All four proteins are predicted to be localized in a membrane via a common NH2-terminal domain, which consists of either five or seven membrane-spanning helices. The COOH-terminal portion of each of these proteins, although less conserved, is predicted to be a water-soluble, globular domain. These sequence similarities indicate that these plant orthologs may belong to a superfamily of membrane-bound receptors that have been extensively characterized from animals, including the HIV co-receptor fusin (also termed CXCR4).",10.1104/pp.113.4.1091,True,high,True,high,"[""Zea mays"", ""Kleinia odora"", ""Arabidopsis thaliana"", ""Oryza sativa""]","[""cuticular wax biosynthesis"", ""lipid transport"", ""membrane localization of wax synthesis enzymes""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Zea mays"", ""Kleinia odora"", ""Arabidopsis thaliana"", ""Oryza sativa""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Mutations at the glossy1 (gl1) locus of maize (Zea mays L.) quantitatively and qualitatively affect the deposition of cuticular waxes on the surface of seedling leaves."", ""These are the Arabidopsis CER1 protein, which is involved in cuticular wax deposition on siliques, stems, and leaves of that plant.""], ""explanation"": ""Cuticular waxes are long-chain fatty acid derivatives deposited on plant surfaces; the study focuses on genes regulating their biosynthesis and deposition, directly implicating lipid metabolic pathways."", ""specific_topics"": [""cuticular wax biosynthesis"", ""lipid transport"", ""membrane localization of wax synthesis enzymes""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",2: Lipid Transport & Trafficking,success,2.0,Lipid Transport & Trafficking
23220695,"ABCG15 encodes an ABC transporter protein, and is essential for post-meiotic anther and pollen exine development in rice.","In flowering plants, anther and pollen development is critical for male reproductive success. The anther cuticle and pollen exine play an essential role, and in many cereals, such as rice, orbicules/ubisch bodies are also thought to be important for pollen development. The formation of the anther cuticle, exine and orbicules is associated with the biosynthesis and transport of wax, cutin and sporopollenin components. Recently, progress has been made in understanding the biosynthesis of sporopollenin and cutin components in Arabidopsis and rice, but less is known about the mechanisms by which they are transported to the sites of deposition. Here, we report that the rice ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, ABCG15, is essential for post-meiotic anther and pollen development, and is proposed to play a role in the transport of rice anther cuticle and sporopollenin precursors. ABCG15 is highly expressed in the tapetum at the young microspore stage, and the abcg15 mutant exhibits small, white anthers lacking mature pollen, lipidic cuticle, orbicules and pollen exine. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the abcg15 anther cuticle revealed significant reductions in a number of wax components and aliphatic cutin monomers.

The development of the cell plate aligns with alterations in the cytoskeleton structure and vesicles derived from the trans-Golgi, ultimately resulting in the formation of the cell plate.

Since the levels of PtdIns(3)P in plants are low, we examined whether Phytophthora species may produce PtdIns(3)P to promote infection. We observed that PtdIns(3)P-specific GFP biosensors could bind to P. parasitica and P. sojae hyphae during infection of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves transiently secreting the biosensors, suggesting that the hyphae exposed PtdIns(3)P on their plasma membrane and/or secreted PtdIns(3)P.

Recent data suggest that these secreted proteins play a key role in the formation of cuticular wax layers and in defence mechanisms against pathogens. In this study, X-ray crystallography has been used to examine the structural details of the interaction between a wheat type 2 ns-LTP and a lipid, L-alpha-palmitoyl-phosphatidyl glycerol. This crystal structure was solved ab initio at 1.12 A resolution by direct methods. The typical alpha-helical bundle fold of this protein is maintained by four disulfide bridges and delineates two hydrophobic cavities. The inner surface of the main cavity is lined by non-polar residues that provide a hydrophobic environment for the palmitoyl moiety of the lipid. The head-group region of this lipid protrudes from the surface and makes several polar interactions with a conserved patch of basic residues at the entrance of the pocket. The alkyl chain of a second lipid is bound within an adjacent smaller cavity.

We still know surprisingly little about some aspects of this process, starting with exocytotic vesicle formation, which may take place at the trans-Golgi network even without coat assistance, facilitated by the local regulation of membrane lipid organization. The RabA4b guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase), recruiting phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase to the trans-Golgi network, is a candidate vesicle formation organizer. However, in plant cells, there are obviously additional endosomal source compartments for secretory vesicles. The Rho/Rop GTPase regulatory module is central for the initiation of exocytotically active domains in plant cell cortex (activated cortical domains). Most plant cells exhibit several distinct plasma membrane domains, established and maintained by endocytosis-driven membrane recycling. We propose the concept of a 'recycling domain', uniting the activated cortical domain and the connected endosomal compartments, as a dynamic spatiotemporal entity. We have recently described the exocyst tethering complex in plant cells. As a result of the multiplicity of its putative Exo70 subunits, this complex may belong to core regulators of recycling domain organization, including the generation of multiple recycling domains within a single cell.

12932321,Arabidopsis sterol endocytosis involves actin-mediated trafficking via ARA6-positive early endosomes.,"In contrast to the intense attention devoted to research on intracellular sterol trafficking in animal cells, knowledge about sterol transport in plant cells remains limited, and virtually nothing is known about plant endocytic sterol trafficking. Similar to animals, biosynthetic sterol transport occurs from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. The vesicle trafficking inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA) has been suggested to disrupt biosynthetic sterol transport at the Golgi level. Here, we report on early endocytic sterol trafficking in Arabidopsis root epidermal cells by introducing filipin as a tool for fluorescent sterol detection. Sterols can be internalized from the plasma membrane and localize to endosomes positive for the early endosomal Rab5 GTPase homolog ARA6 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) (ARA6-GFP). Early endocytic sterol transport is actin dependent and highly BFA sensitive. BFA causes coaccumulation of sterols, endocytic markers like ARA6-GFP, and PIN2, a polarly localized presumptive auxin transport protein, in early endosome agglomerations that can be distinguished from ER and Golgi. Sterol accumulation in such aggregates is enhanced in actin2 mutants, and the actin-depolymerizing drug cytochalasin D inhibits sterol redistribution from endosome aggregations. Early endocytic sterol trafficking involves transport via ARA6-positive early endosomes that, in contrast to animal cells, is actin dependent. Our results reveal sterol-enriched early endosomes as targets for BFA interference in plants.

18803664,Calmodulin binds to maize lipid transfer protein and modulates its lipids binding ability.,"Although plant non-specific lipid transfer proteins (ns-LTPs) are characterized by their ability to bind and transfer a broad range of hydrophobic ligands in vitro, their biological functions in vivo remain unclear. Recently, it has been proposed that ns-LTPs may play a key role in plant defense mechanisms, particularly during the induction of systemic acquired resistance, however, very little is known about the regulation in this process. We report that the binding of maize non-specific lipid transfer protein (Zm-LTP) to calmodulin (CaM) is in a calcium-independent manner. To better understand the interaction mechanism between Zm-LTP and CaM, the CaM-binding site of Zm-LTP was mapped to the region of amino acids 46-60. Point mutations indicate that four amino acid residues, R46, R47, K54 and R58, in this region are crucial for binding. Furthermore, we tested the effects of CaM on the lipid-binding activity of Zm-LTP in the presence of Ca(2+), EGTA, N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalene sulfonamide and trifluoperazine respectively. We also investigated the structural features of CaM-binding motifs in LTPs from different species and strong differences were observed.

20044438,A gain-of-function mutation of Arabidopsis lipid transfer protein 5 disturbs pollen tube tip growth and fertilization.,"During compatible pollination of the angiosperms, pollen tubes grow in the pistil transmitting tract (TT) and are guided to the ovule for fertilization. Lily (Lilium longiflorum) stigma/style Cys-rich adhesin (SCA), a plant lipid transfer protein (LTP), is a small, secreted peptide involved in pollen tube adhesion-mediated guidance. Here, we used a reverse genetic approach to study biological roles of Arabidopsis thaliana LTP5, a SCA-like LTP. The T-DNA insertional gain-of-function mutant plant for LTP5 (ltp5-1) exhibited ballooned pollen tubes, delayed pollen tube growth, and decreased numbers of fertilized eggs. Our reciprocal cross-pollination study revealed that ltp5-1 results in both male and female partial sterility. RT-PCR and beta-glucuronidase analyses showed that LTP5 is present in pollen and the pistil TT in low levels. Pollen-targeted overexpression of either ltp5-1 or wild-type LTP5 resulted in defects in polar tip growth of pollen tubes and thereby decreased seed set, suggesting that mutant ltp5-1 acts as a dominant-active form of wild-type LTP5 in pollen tube growth. The ltp5-1 protein has additional hydrophobic C-terminal sequences, compared with LTP5.

27458082,Ligand binding to an Allergenic Lipid Transfer Protein Enhances Conformational Flexibility resulting in an Increase in Susceptibility to Gastroduodenal Proteolysis.,"Non-specific lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) are a family of lipid-binding molecules that are widely distributed across flowering plant species, many of which have been identified as allergens. They are highly resistant to simulated gastroduodenal proteolysis, a property that may play a role in determining their allergenicity and it has been suggested that lipid binding may further increase stability to proteolysis. It is demonstrated that LTPs from wheat and peach bind a range of lipids in a variety of conditions, including those found in the gastroduodenal tract. Both LTPs are initially cleaved during gastroduodenal proteolysis at three major sites between residues 39-40, 56-57 and 79-80, with wheat LTP being more resistant to cleavage than its peach ortholog. The susceptibility of wheat LTP to proteolyic cleavage increases significantly upon lipid binding. This enhanced digestibility is likely to be due to the displacement of Tyr79 and surrounding residues from the internal hydrophobic cavity upon ligand binding to the solvent exposed exterior of the LTP, facilitating proteolysis. Such knowledge contributes to our understanding as to how resistance to digestion can be used in allergenicity risk assessment of novel food proteins, including GMOs.",10.1038/srep30279,True,high,True,high,"[""wheat"", ""peach""]","[""lipid binding"", ""proteolysis"", ""allergenicity""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""wheat"", ""peach""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Non\u2011specific lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) are a family of lipid\u2011binding molecules that are widely distributed across flowering plant species, many of which have been identified as allergens."", ""It is demonstrated that LTPs from wheat and peach bind a range of lipids in a variety of conditions, including those found in the gastroduodenal tract.""], ""explanation"": ""The paper explicitly studies lipid binding to non\u2011specific lipid transfer proteins from wheat and peach, examining how this interaction affects conformational flexibility and susceptibility to proteolysis, thereby addressing lipid\u2013protein interactions."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid binding"", ""proteolysis"", ""allergenicity""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",2: Lipid Transport & Trafficking,success,2.0,Lipid Transport & Trafficking

Their possible involvement in fatty acid transportation from the plastid to the endoplasmic reticulum, prior to the formation of triacylglycerol has been suggested. Four classes of ACBPs were identified in Arabidopsis thaliana: the small ACBPs, the large ACBPs, the ankyrin repeats containing ACBPs and the kelch motif containing ACBPs. They differed in structure and in size, and showed multiple important functions. In the present study, Brassica napus ACBPs were identified and characterized. Eight copies of kelch motif ACBPs were cloned, it showed that B. napus ACBPs shared high amino acid sequence identity with A. thaliana, Brassica rapa and Brassica oleracea. Furthermore, phylogeny based on domain structure and comparison map showed the relationship and the evolution of ACBPs within Brassicaceae family: ACBPs evolved into four separate classes with different structure. Chromosome locations comparison showed conserved syntenic blocks. ACBPs were highly conserved in Brassicaceae. They evolved from a common ancestor, but domain duplication and rearrangement might separate them into four distinct classes, with different structure and functions. Otherwise, B. napus inherited kelch motif ACBPs from ancestor conserving chromosomal location, emphasizing preserved synteny block region.

17277094,"EpsinR2 interacts with clathrin, adaptor protein-3, AtVTI12, and phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate. Implications for EpsinR2 function in protein trafficking in plant cells.","Members of the epsin family of proteins (epsins) are characterized by the presence of an epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain. Epsins have been implicated in various protein-trafficking pathways in animal and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells. Plant cells also contain multiple epsin-related proteins. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), EPSIN1 is involved in vacuolar trafficking of soluble proteins. In this study, we investigated the role of Arabidopsis EpsinR2 in protein trafficking in plant cells. EpsinR2 contains a highly conserved ENTH domain but a fairly divergent C-terminal sequence. We found that the N-terminal ENTH domain specifically binds to phosphatidylinositol-3-P in vitro and has a critical role in the targeting of EpsinR2. Upon transient expression in protoplasts, hemagglutinin epitope-tagged EpsinR2 was translocated primarily to a novel cellular compartment, while a minor portion localized to the Golgi complex. Protein-binding experiments showed that EpsinR2 interacts with clathrin, AtVTI12, and the Arabidopsis homologs of adaptor protein-3 delta-adaptin and adaptor protein-2 alpha-adaptin. Localization experiments revealed that hemagglutinin epitope-tagged EpsinR2 colocalizes primarily with delta-adaptin and partially colocalizes with clathrin and AtVTI12.

20028486,Glucosylceramide biosynthesis is involved in Golgi morphology and protein secretion in plant cells.,"Lipids have an established role as structural components of membranes or as signalling molecules, but their role as molecular actors in protein secretion is less clear. The complex sphingolipid glucosylceramide (GlcCer) is enriched in the plasma membrane and lipid microdomains of plant cells, but compared to animal and yeast cells, little is known about the role of GlcCer in plant physiology. We have investigated the influence of GlcCer biosynthesis by glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) on the efficiency of protein transport through the plant secretory pathway and on the maintenance of normal Golgi structure. We determined that GlcCer is synthesized at the beginning of the plant secretory pathway [mainly endoplasmic reticulum (ER)] and that D,L-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoyl amino-3-morpholino-propanol (PDMP) is a potent inhibitor of plant GCS activity in vitro and in vivo. By an in vivo confocal microscopy approach in tobacco leaves infiltrated with PDMP, we showed that the decrease in GlcCer biosynthesis disturbed the transport of soluble and membrane secretory proteins to the cell surface, as these proteins were partly retained intracellularly in the ER and/or Golgi. Electron microscopic observations of Arabidopsis thaliana root cells after high-pressure freezing and freeze substitution evidenced strong morphological changes in the Golgi bodies, pointing to a link between decreased protein secretion and perturbations of Golgi structure following inhibition of GlcCer biosynthesis in plant cells.",10.1111/j.1600-0854.2009.01030.x,True,high,True,high,"[""tobacco"", ""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""sphingolipid metabolism"", ""Golgi structure"", ""protein trafficking""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""tobacco"", ""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Lipids have an established role as structural components of membranes or as signalling molecules, but their role as molecular actors in protein secretion is less clear."", ""The complex sphingolipid glucosylceramide (GlcCer) is enriched in the plasma membrane and lipid microdomains of plant cells, but compared to animal and yeast cells, little is known about the role of GlcCer in plant physiology.""], ""explanation"": ""The study focuses on the biosynthesis of the sphingolipid glucosylceramide (GlcCer), examining how its production affects protein transport and Golgi morphology in plant cells, thereby directly investigating lipid function and metabolism."", ""specific_topics"": [""sphingolipid metabolism"", ""Golgi structure"", ""protein trafficking""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",2: Lipid Transport & Trafficking,success,2.0,Lipid Transport & Trafficking
17786450,Localized endocytosis in tobacco pollen tubes: visualisation and dynamics of membrane retrieval by a fluorescent phospholipid.,"Two modes of endocytosis are known to occur in eucaryotic cells: fluid phase and receptor-mediated endocytosis. Fluid-phase endocytosis in plant cells resembles the retrieval of excess plasma membrane material previously incorporated by exocytosis. Pollen tubes need to carry out strong membrane retrieval due to their fast polar tip growth. Plasma membrane labelling of pollen tubes, grown in suspension, was achieved by the incorporation of a fluorescently modified phospholipid, 1,2-bis-(4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-undecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (20 microM) and measured with a confocal laser-scanning microscope. Time course experiments revealed a highly localised and relatively fast plasma membrane retrieval below the tip within the first 5 min after phospholipid application. The retrieved fluorescent plasma membrane was quickly re-integrated into parts of the endomembrane pool and then redistributed to the pollen tube base and very tip of the apex, with the exception of the cortical endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the mitochondria even after 1-h incubation period. Low temperature (10 degrees C) and the actin filament depolymerizing cytochalasin D (2 microM) completely abolished plasma membrane retrieval, whereas the microtubule destabilizing herbicide oryzalin (1 microM) had no effect. Our results provide strong support for a highly localised endocytotic pathway in tobacco pollen tubes. Passive uptake of bis-Bodipy FL C(11)-phosphocholine by mere penetration can be excluded.

How mobile are these potent mediators within tissues? Exploiting a series of 13-lipoxygenase (13-lox) mutants in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) that displays impaired jasmonic acid (JA) synthesis in specific cell types and using JA-inducible reporters, we mapped the extent of the transport of endogenous jasmonates across the plant vegetative growth phase. In seedlings, we found that jasmonate (or JA precursors) could translocate axially from wounded shoots to unwounded roots in a LOX2-dependent manner. Grafting experiments with the wild type and JA-deficient mutants confirmed shoot-to-root oxylipin transport. Next, we used rosettes to investigate radial cell-to-cell transport of jasmonates. After finding that the LOX6 protein localized to xylem contact cells was not wound inducible, we used the lox234 triple mutant to genetically isolate LOX6 as the only JA precursor-producing LOX in the plant. When a leaf of this mutant was wounded, the JA reporter gene was expressed in distal leaves. Leaf sectioning showed that JA reporter expression extended from contact cells throughout the vascular bundle and into extravascular cells, revealing a radial movement of jasmonates. Our results add a crucial element to a growing picture of how the distal wound response is regulated in rosettes, showing that both axial (shoot-to-root) and radial (cell-to-cell) transport of oxylipins plays a major role in the wound response.

40171957,SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS 81 regulates fatty acid desaturation by mediating Acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase 5 during seed development in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"Lipids are essential for building cells and are used as important seed reserves. Fatty acids (FAs) are the key structural units of lipids, forming their hydrophobic tails in triglycerides and phospholipids. FA synthesis starts in plastids and is completed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS 81 (SYP81), a Qa-soluble N-ETHYLMALEIMIDE SENSITIVE FACTOR attachment protein receptor (Qa-SNARE), regulates vesicle trafficking between the ER and Golgi apparatus, yet its role in FA synthesis is unknown. Here, we examined the expression of SYP81 during Arabidopsis thaliana seed development and found that the syp81 mutation reduced Acyl-Acyl Desaturase 5 (AAD5) accumulation in plastids of Arabidopsis embryonic cells and thus significantly decreased unsaturated FA production. Pull-down experiments identified possible interactors with SYP81, including various Stearoyl-Acyl carrier protein Desaturases (SADs), notably AAD5, and Translocons at Outer envelope membranes of Chloroplast (TOCs), especially TOC33. To validate these interactions, CoIP, yeast-two-hybridization assays, and bimolecular-fluorescence-complementation experiments were performed. The results of these experiments supported the interaction between SYP81 and AAD5, as well as SYP81 and TOC33. Based on these findings, a model was proposed, suggesting that pre-AAD5, recruited by SYP81, translocates from the ER to the plastids through the TIC-TOC complex mediations.

19121948,An Arabidopsis family of six acyl-CoA-binding proteins has three cytosolic members.,"In Arabidopsis thaliana, a gene family of six members encodes acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs). These Arabidopsis ACBPs (designated ACBP1 to ACBP6) range in size from 10.4kDa to 73.1kDa and display varying affinities for acyl-CoA esters, suggesting that they have different roles in plant lipid metabolism. In contrast, only the 10-kDa ACBPs have been well-characterized from other eukaryote species. Our previous studies have revealed that ACBP1 and ACBP2 are membrane-associated proteins, while ACBP3 is extracellularly-targeted. More recently, we have reported that the remaining three members in this protein family (namely ACBP4, ACBP5 and ACBP6) are subcellularly localized to the cytosol in Arabidopsis. The subcellular localizations of ACBP4, ACBP5 and ACBP6 in the cytosol were demonstrated using a number of different approaches incorporating biochemical fractionation, confocal microscopy of transgenic Arabidopsis expressing autofluorescence-tagged fusions and immunoelectron microscopy using ACBP-specific antibodies.

27688623,The Nonspecific Lipid Transfer Protein AtLtpI-4 Is Involved in Suberin Formation of Arabidopsis thaliana Crown Galls.,"Nonspecific lipid transfer proteins reversibly bind different types of lipid molecules in a hydrophobic cavity. They facilitate phospholipid transfer between membranes in vitro, play a role in cuticle and possibly in suberin formation, and might be involved in plant pathogen defense signaling. This study focuses on the role of the lipid transfer protein AtLTPI-4 in crown gall development. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) crown gall tumors, which develop upon infection with the virulent Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58, highly expressed AtLTPI-4 Crown galls of the atltpI-4 loss-of-function mutant were much smaller compared with those of wild-type plants. The gene expression pattern and localization of the protein to the plasma membrane pointed to a function of AtLTPI-4 in cell wall suberization. Since Arabidopsis crown galls are covered by a suberin-containing periderm instead of a cuticle, we analyzed the suberin composition of crown galls and found a reduction in the amounts of long-chain fatty acids (C<sub>18:0</sub>) in the atltpI-4 mutant. To demonstrate the impact of AtLtpI-4 on extracellular lipid composition, we expressed the protein in Arabidopsis epidermis cells. This led to a significant increase in the very-long-chain fatty acids C<sub>24</sub> and C<sub>26</sub> in the cuticular wax fraction. Homology modeling and lipid-protein-overlay assays showed that AtLtpI-4 protein can bind these very-long-chain fatty acids. Thus, AtLtpI-4 protein may facilitate the transfer of long-chain as well as very-long-chain fatty acids into the apoplast, depending on the cell type in which it is expressed. In crown galls, which endogenously express AtLtpI-4, it is involved in suberin formation.",10.1104/pp.16.01486,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""fatty acid transport"", ""suberin biosynthesis"", ""lipid transfer proteins""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Since Arabidopsis crown galls are covered by a suberin-containing periderm instead of a cuticle, we analyzed the suberin composition of crown galls and found a reduction in the amounts of long-chain fatty acids (C18:0) in the atltpI-4 mutant."", ""Homology modeling and lipid\u2011protein\u2011overlay assays showed that AtLtpI-4 protein can bind these very\u2011long\u2011chain fatty acids.""], ""explanation"": ""The study investigates how the nonspecific lipid transfer protein AtLtpI-4 mediates the movement of long\u2011chain and very\u2011long\u2011chain fatty acids into the apoplast, influencing suberin and cuticular wax composition in Arabidopsis crown galls."", ""specific_topics"": [""fatty acid transport"", ""suberin biosynthesis"", ""lipid transfer proteins""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",2: Lipid Transport & Trafficking,success,2.0,Lipid Transport & Trafficking
18251711,Sealing plant surfaces: cuticular wax formation by epidermal cells.,"The vital importance of plant surface wax in protecting tissue from environmental stresses is reflected in the huge commitment of epidermal cells to cuticle formation. During cuticle deposition, a massive flux of lipids occurs from the sites of lipid synthesis in the plastid and the endoplasmic reticulum to the plant surface. Recent genetic studies in Arabidopsis have improved our understanding of fatty acid elongation and of the subsequent modification of the elongated products into primary alcohols, wax esters, secondary alcohols, and ketones, shedding light on the enzymes involved in these pathways. In contrast, the biosynthesis of alkanes is still poorly understood, as are the mechanisms of wax transport from the site of biosynthesis to the cuticle. Currently, nothing is known about wax trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane, or about translocation through the cell wall to the cuticle. However, a first breakthrough toward an understanding of wax export recently came with the discovery of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters that are involved in releasing wax from the plasma membrane into the apoplast. An overview of our present knowledge of wax biosynthesis and transport and the regulation of these processes during cuticle assembly is presented, including the evidence for coordination of cutin polyester and wax production.",10.1146/annurev.arplant.59.103006.093219,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""fatty acid elongation"", ""lipid transport"", ""wax biosynthesis""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""During cuticle deposition, a massive flux of lipids occurs from the sites of lipid synthesis in the plastid and the endoplasmic reticulum to the plant surface."", ""Recent genetic studies in Arabidopsis have improved our understanding of fatty acid elongation and of the subsequent modification of the elongated products into primary alcohols, wax esters, secondary alcohols, and ketones.""], ""explanation"": ""The study focuses on the synthesis, modification, and transport of lipids\u2014specifically fatty acids and their derivatives\u2014in plant cuticular wax formation."", ""specific_topics"": [""fatty acid elongation"", ""lipid transport"", ""wax biosynthesis""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",2: Lipid Transport & Trafficking,success,2.0,Lipid Transport & Trafficking
17114270,Insights into the role of specific lipids in the formation and delivery of lipid microdomains to the plasma membrane of plant cells.,"The existence of sphingolipid- and sterol-enriched microdomains, known as lipid rafts, in the plasma membrane (PM) of eukaryotic cells is well documented. To obtain more insight into the lipid molecular species required for the formation of microdomains in plants, we have isolated detergent (Triton X-100)-resistant membranes (DRMs) from the PM of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and leek (Allium porrum) seedlings as well as from Arabidopsis cell cultures. Here, we show that all DRM preparations are enriched in sterols, sterylglucosides, and glucosylceramides (GluCer) and depleted in glycerophospholipids. The GluCer of DRMs from leek seedlings contain hydroxypalmitic acid. We investigated the role of sterols in DRM formation along the secretory pathway in leek seedlings. We present evidence for the presence of DRMs in both the PM and the Golgi apparatus but not in the endoplasmic reticulum. In leek seedlings treated with fenpropimorph, a sterol biosynthesis inhibitor, the usual Delta(5)-sterols are replaced by 9beta,19-cyclopropylsterols. In these plants, sterols and hydroxypalmitic acid-containing GluCer do not reach the PM, and most DRMs are recovered from the Golgi apparatus, indicating that Delta(5)-sterols and GluCer play a crucial role in lipid microdomain formation and delivery to the PM.

21223384,An ABCG/WBC-type ABC transporter is essential for transport of sporopollenin precursors for exine formation in developing pollen.,"The exine of the pollen wall shows an intricate pattern, primarily comprising sporopollenin, a polymer of fatty acids and phenolic compounds. A series of enzymes synthesize sporopollenin precursors in tapetal cells, and the precursors are transported from the tapetum to the pollen surface. However, the mechanisms underlying the transport of sporopollenin precursors remain elusive. Here, we provide evidence that strongly suggests that the Arabidopsis ABC transporter ABCG26/WBC27 is involved in the transport of sporopollenin precursors. Two independent mutations at ABCG26 coding region caused drastic decrease in seed production. This defect was complemented by expression of ABCG26 driven by its native promoter. The severely reduced fertility of the abcg26 mutants was caused by a failure to produce mature pollen, observed initially as a defect in pollen-wall development. The reticulate pattern of the exine of wild-type microspores was absent in abcg26 microspores at the vacuolate stage, and the vast majority of the mutant pollen degenerated thereafter. ABCG26 was expressed specifically in tapetal cells at the early vacuolate stage of pollen development. It showed high co-expression with genes encoding enzymes required for sporopollenin precursor synthesis, i.e. CYP704B1, ACOS5, MS2 and CYP703A2. Similar to two other mutants with defects in pollen-wall deposition, abcg26 tapetal cells accumulated numerous vesicles and granules. Taken together, these results suggest that ABCG26 plays a crucial role in the transfer of sporopollenin lipid precursors from tapetal cells to anther locules, facilitating exine formation on the pollen surface.",10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04412.x,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""sporopollenin precursor transport"", ""lipid transport"", ""pollen wall formation""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""The exine of the pollen wall shows an intricate pattern, primarily comprising sporopollenin, a polymer of fatty acids and phenolic compounds."", ""Taken together, these results suggest that ABCG26 plays a crucial role in the transfer of sporopollenin lipid precursors from tapetal cells to anther locules, facilitating exine formation on the pollen surface.""], ""explanation"": ""The study focuses on the transport of sporopollenin precursors, which are lipid-derived polymers, indicating investigation into lipid-related processes within plant reproductive biology."", ""specific_topics"": [""sporopollenin precursor transport"", ""lipid transport"", ""pollen wall formation""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",2: Lipid Transport & Trafficking,success,2.0,Lipid Transport & Trafficking

Free metal ion activity was estimated using the chemical equilibrium program MINTEQ or measured by Donnan dialysis. The uptake of Cd followed the FIAM for the EDTA-buffered solution at EDTA concentrations below 0.4 μM; for the rhamnolipid-buffered solution, the uptake of both metals in roots was not markedly affected by increasing rhamnolipid concentrations in solution. This suggests rhamnolipid enhanced metal accumulation in plant roots (per unit free metal in solution) possibly through formation and uptake of lipophilic complexes. The addition of normal Ca concentrations (low millimetre range) to the rhamnolipid uptake solutions reduced Cd accumulation in shoots by inhibiting Cd translocation, whereas it significantly increased Zn accumulation in shoots. This study confirms that although rhamnolipid could enhance accumulation of Cd in plants roots at low Ca supply, it is not suitable for Cd phytoextraction in contaminated soil environments where Ca concentrations in soil solution are orders of magnitude greater than those of Cd.",10.1007/s11356-016-7367-9,True,high,True,high,"[""Helianthus annuus""]","[""biosurfactants"", ""metal\u2011lipid complexation"", ""phytoextraction""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Helianthus annuus""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""This suggests rhamnolipid enhanced metal accumulation in plant roots (per unit free metal in solution) possibly through formation and uptake of lipophilic complexes."", ""For the rhamnolipid-buffered solution, the uptake of both metals in roots was not markedly affected by increasing rhamnolipid concentrations in solution.""], ""explanation"": ""Rhamnolipid is a glycolipid biosurfactant whose interaction with heavy metals influences metal speciation and uptake, directly involving lipid chemistry and processes such as complexation and transport."", ""specific_topics"": [""biosurfactants"", ""metal\u2011lipid complexation"", ""phytoextraction""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",2: Lipid Transport & Trafficking,success,2.0,Lipid Transport & Trafficking

Complementation of a yeast mutant deficient in peroxisomal ATP import and in vitro transport assays using recombinant transporter proteins revealed that PNC1 and PNC2 catalyze the counterexchange of ATP with ADP or AMP. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines repressing both PNC genes were generated using ethanol-inducible RNA interference. A detailed analysis of these plants showed that an impaired peroxisomal ATP import inhibits fatty acid breakdown during early seedling growth and other beta-oxidation reactions, such as auxin biosynthesis.

11308329,Identification of a new form of lipid transfer protein (LTP1) in wheat seeds.,"Recently, this laboratory has isolated from barley and beer extract an isoform of lipid transfer protein (LTP1), which was not fully sequenced (Jégou, S.; Douliez, J. P.; Mollé, D.; Boivin, P.; Marion, D. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2000, 48, 5023--5029). It was named LTP1b and exhibited a molecular weight 294 Da higher than that of the known LTP1. This paper reports the finding of an LTP1 isoform in wheat that also exhibits an excess of 294 Da compared to the native protein. Amino acid sequencing, reduction and alkylation, and mass spectrometry showed that this new LTP1b possesses the same N-terminal sequence as the native LTP1, suggesting that the difference resides in the binding of an adduct which has a molecular weight of 294 Da.

21445098,Calcium-dependent modulation and plasma membrane targeting of the AKT2 potassium channel by the CBL4/CIPK6 calcium sensor/protein kinase complex.,"Potassium (K(+)) channel function is fundamental to many physiological processes. However, components and mechanisms regulating the activity of plant K(+) channels remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the calcium (Ca(2+)) sensor CBL4 together with the interacting protein kinase CIPK6 modulates the activity and plasma membrane (PM) targeting of the K(+) channel AKT2 from Arabidopsis thaliana by mediating translocation of AKT2 to the PM in plant cells and enhancing AKT2 activity in oocytes. Accordingly, akt2, cbl4 and cipk6 mutants share similar developmental and delayed flowering phenotypes. Moreover, the isolated regulatory C-terminal domain of CIPK6 is sufficient for mediating CBL4- and Ca(2+)-dependent channel translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane to the PM by a novel targeting pathway that is dependent on dual lipid modifications of CBL4 by myristoylation and palmitoylation. Thus, we describe a critical mechanism of ion-channel regulation where a Ca(2+) sensor modulates K(+) channel activity by promoting a kinase interaction-dependent but phosphorylation-independent translocation of the channel to the PM.",10.1038/cr.2011.50,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""lipid modification"", ""protein lipidation"", ""myristoylation"", ""palmitoylation""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Moreover, the isolated regulatory C-terminal domain of CIPK6 is sufficient for mediating CBL4- and Ca(2+)-dependent channel translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane to the PM by a novel targeting pathway that is dependent on dual lipid modifications of CBL4 by myristoylation and palmitoylation.""], ""explanation"": ""The study explicitly investigates how dual lipid modifications (myristoylation and palmitoylation) of the calcium sensor CBL4 influence its ability to mediate potassium channel translocation to the plasma membrane, thereby addressing a lipid-based regulatory mechanism."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid modification"", ""protein lipidation"", ""myristoylation"", ""palmitoylation""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",2: Lipid Transport & Trafficking,success,2.0,Lipid Transport & Trafficking
24625031,Transcriptomic analysis reveals that reactive oxygen species and genes encoding lipid transfer protein are associated with tobacco hairy root growth and branch development.,"The hairy root, a specialized plant tissue that emerges from a cell transformed with transfer DNA (T-DNA) from Agrobacterium rhizogenes, can be used to study root biology and utilized in biotechnological applications. The rol genes are known to participate in the generation of hairy roots; however, the means by which the rol genes contribute to the initiation and the maintenance of hairy roots remains largely unknown. We demonstrated that tobacco hairy roots lacking either rolB or rolC exhibited fewer branch roots and lost their growth ability in long-term subculture. Additionally, a microarray analysis revealed that the expression of several genes encoding lipid transfer proteins (LTP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related genes was significantly suppressed in rolB- or rolC-deficient hairy roots. We found that hairy root clones that exhibited greater branching expressed higher levels of RolB or RolC and the genes encoding LTP identified from the microarray. When hairy roots were compared with intact roots, the expression levels of LTP-encoding genes were dramatically different. In addition, ROS were present at lower levels in rolB- and rolC-deficient hairy roots.

7559754,Different sensitivity to wortmannin of two vacuolar sorting signals indicates the presence of distinct sorting machineries in tobacco cells.,"Vacuolar matrix proteins in plant cells are sorted from the secretory pathway to the vacuoles at the Golgi apparatus. Previously, we reported that the NH2-terminal propeptide (NTPP) of the sporamin precursor and the COOH-terminal propeptide (CTPP) of the barley lectin precursor contain information for vacuolar sorting. To analyze whether these propeptides are interchangeable, we expressed constructs consisting of wild-type or mutated NTPP with the mature part of barley lectin and sporamin with CTPP and mutated NTPP in tobacco BY-2 cells. The vacuolar localization of these constructs indicated that the signals were interchangeable. We next analyzed the effect of wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of mammalian phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase on vacuolar delivery by NTPP and CTPP in tobacco cells. Pulse-chase analysis indicated that 33 microM wortmannin caused almost complete inhibition of CTPP-mediated transport to the vacuoles, while NTPP-mediated transport displayed almost no sensitivity to wortmannin at this concentration. This indicates that there are at least two different mechanisms for vacuolar sorting in tobacco cells, and the CTPP-mediated pathway is sensitive to wortmannin. We compared the dose dependencies of wortmannin on the inhibition of CTPP-mediated vacuolar delivery of proteins and on the inhibition of the synthesis of phospholipids in tobacco cells. Wortmannin inhibited PI 3- and PI 4-kinase activities and phospholipid synthesis. Missorting caused by wortmannin displays a dose dependency that is similar to the dose dependency for the inhibition of synthesis of PI 4-phosphate and major phospholipids. This is different, however, than the inhibition of synthesis of PI 3-phosphate. Thus, the synthesis of phospholipids could be involved in CTPP-mediated vacuolar transport.",10.1083/jcb.130.6.1307,True,high,True,high,"[""tobacco""]","[""phospholipid synthesis"", ""PI kinase activity"", ""wortmannin inhibition""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""tobacco""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Wortmannin inhibited PI 3- and PI 4-kinase activities and phospholipid synthesis."", ""Missorting caused by wortmannin displays a dose dependency that is similar to the dose dependency for the inhibition of synthesis of PI 4-phosphate and major phospholipids.""], ""explanation"": ""The study investigates how wortmannin affects phospholipid synthesis and PI kinase activities, linking vacuolar sorting pathways to lipid metabolic processes."", ""specific_topics"": [""phospholipid synthesis"", ""PI kinase activity"", ""wortmannin inhibition""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",2: Lipid Transport & Trafficking,success,2.0,Lipid Transport & Trafficking

Among the four proteins detected, one of them (peak IV) appeared purified to homogeneity. This protein is a monomer with a molecular mass of about 9 kDa, as estimated by gel filtration and by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The isoelectric point of the rape protein was higher than 10.5 as determined by chromatofocusing. The pure rape protein appeared furthermore to be able to transfer several phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylethanolamine) between membranes. The rape protein, having a multifunctional property, was thus called acyl-binding/lipid-transfer protein (AB-LTP). In order to compare this protein to plant lipid-transfer proteins (LTPs), its structure was determined. The amino acid analysis of the rape AB-LTP revealed a high amount of alanine, an absence of histidine and tryptophan and the presence of eight cysteine residues. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the rape protein revealed a high homology to plant LTPs.

27645136,Arabidopsis acyl-CoA-binding protein ACBP6 localizes in the phloem and affects jasmonate composition.,"Arabidopsis thaliana ACYL-COA-BINDING PROTEIN6 (AtACBP6) encodes a cytosolic 10-kDa AtACBP. It confers freezing tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis, possibly by its interaction with lipids as indicated by the binding of acyl-CoA esters and phosphatidylcholine to recombinant AtACBP6. Herein, transgenic Arabidopsis transformed with an AtACBP6 promoter-driven β-glucuronidase (GUS) construct exhibited strong GUS activity in the vascular tissues. Immunoelectron microscopy using anti-AtACBP6 antibodies showed AtACBP6 localization in the phloem especially in the companion cells and sieve elements. Also, the presence of gold grains in the plasmodesmata indicated its potential role in systemic trafficking. The AtACBP6 protein, but not its mRNA, was found in phloem exudate of wild-type Arabidopsis. Fatty acid profiling using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed an increase in the jasmonic acid (JA) precursor, 12-oxo-cis,cis-10,15-phytodienoic acid (cis-OPDA), and a reduction in JA and/or its derivatives in acbp6 phloem exudates in comparison to the wild type. Quantitative real-time PCR showed down-regulation of COMATOSE (CTS) in acbp6 rosettes suggesting that AtACBP6 affects CTS function. AtACBP6 appeared to affect the content of JA and/or its derivatives in the sieve tubes, which is consistent with its role in pathogen-defense and in its wound-inducibility of AtACBP6pro::GUS.

The phenotype of the Arabidopsis ped3 mutant indicated that the mutation in the PED3 gene inhibits the activity of fatty acid beta-oxidation. Ped3p is a 149-kDa protein that exists in peroxisomal membranes. The amino acid sequence of Ped3p had a typical characteristic for ""full-size"" ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter consisting of two transmembrane regions and two ATP-binding regions.

26361871,"Synthesis, metabolism and systemic transport of a fluorinated mimic of the endogenous jasmonate precursor OPC-8:0.","Jasmonates (JAs) are fatty acid derivatives that mediate many developmental processes and stress responses in plants. Synthetic jasmonate derivatives (commonly isotopically labeled), which mimic the action of the endogenous compounds are often employed as internal standards or probes to study metabolic processes. However, stable-isotope labeling of jasmonates does not allow the study of spatial and temporal distribution of these compounds in real time by positron emission tomography (PET). In this study, we explore whether a fluorinated jasmonate could mimic the action of the endogenous compound and therefore, be later employed as a tracer to study metabolic processes by PET. We describe the synthesis and the metabolism of (Z)-7-fluoro-8-(3-oxo-2-(pent-2-en-1-yl)cyclopentyl)octanoic acid (7F-OPC-8:0), a fluorinated analog of the JA precursor OPC-8:0. Like endogenous jasmonates, 7F-OPC-8:0 induces the transcription of marker jasmonate responsive genes (JRG) and the accumulation of jasmonates after its application to Arabidopsis thaliana plants. By using UHPLC-MS/MS, we could show that 7F-OPC-8:0 is metabolized in vivo similarly to the endogenous OPC-8:0. Furthermore, the fluorinated analog was successfully employed as a probe to show its translocation to undamaged systemic leaves when it was applied to wounded leaves. This result suggests that OPC-8:0 - and maybe other oxylipins - may contribute to the mobile signal which triggers systemic defense responses in plants.

24163310,An ATP binding cassette transporter is required for cuticular wax deposition and desiccation tolerance in the moss Physcomitrella patens.,"The plant cuticle is thought to be a critical evolutionary adaptation that allowed the first plants to colonize land, because of its key roles in regulating plant water status and providing protection from biotic and abiotic stresses. Much has been learned about cuticle composition and structure through genetic and biochemical studies of angiosperms, as well as underlying genetic pathways, but little is known about the cuticles of early diverging plant lineages. Here, we demonstrate that the moss Physcomitrella patens, an extant relative of the earliest terrestrial plants, has a cuticle that is analogous in both structure and chemical composition to those of angiosperms. To test whether the underlying cuticle biosynthetic pathways were also shared among distant plant lineages, we generated a genetic knockout of the moss ATP binding cassette subfamily G (ABCG) transporter Pp-ABCG7, a putative ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana ABCG transporters involved in cuticle precursor trafficking. We show that this mutant is severely deficient in cuticular wax accumulation and has a reduced tolerance of desiccation stress compared with the wild type.

23031218,SUCROSE TRANSPORTER 5 supplies Arabidopsis embryos with biotin and affects triacylglycerol accumulation.,"The Arabidopsis SUC5 protein represents a classical sucrose/H(+) symporter. Functional analyses previously revealed that SUC5 also transports biotin, an essential co-factor for fatty acid synthesis. However, evidence for a dual role in transport of the structurally unrelated compounds sucrose and biotin in plants was lacking. Here we show that SUC5 localizes to the plasma membrane, and that the SUC5 gene is expressed in developing embryos, confirming the role of the SUC5 protein as substrate carrier across apoplastic barriers in seeds. We show that transport of biotin but not of sucrose across these barriers is impaired in suc5 mutant embryos. In addition, we show that SUC5 is essential for the delivery of biotin into the embryo of biotin biosynthesis-defective mutants (bio1 and bio2). We compared embryo and seedling development as well as triacylglycerol accumulation and fatty acid composition in seeds of single mutants (suc5, bio1 or bio2), double mutants (suc5 bio1 and suc5 bio2) and wild-type plants. Although suc5 mutants were like the wild-type, bio1 and bio2 mutants showed developmental defects and reduced triacylglycerol contents. In suc5 bio1 and suc5 bio2 double mutants, developmental defects were severely increased and the triacylglycerol content was reduced to a greater extent in comparison to the single mutants. Supplementation with externally applied biotin helped to reduce symptoms in both single and double mutants, but the efficacy of supplementation was significantly lower in double than in single mutants, showing that transport of biotin into the embryo is lower in the absence of SUC5.",10.1111/tpj.12037,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""fatty acid synthesis"", ""triacylglycerol metabolism""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Functional analyses previously revealed that SUC5 also transports biotin, an essential co\u2011factor for fatty acid synthesis."", ""We compared embryo and seedling development as well as triacylglycerol accumulation and fatty acid composition in seeds of single mutants (suc5, bio1 or bio2), double mutants (suc5 bio1 and suc5 bio2) and wild\u2011type plants.""], ""explanation"": ""The study examines how the sucrose transporter SUC5 influences biotin transport, which is crucial for fatty acid synthesis, and directly measures triacylglycerol levels and fatty acid composition in Arabidopsis seeds, thereby addressing lipid metabolic pathways."", ""specific_topics"": [""fatty acid synthesis"", ""triacylglycerol metabolism""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",2: Lipid Transport & Trafficking,success,2.0,Lipid Transport & Trafficking

Because of a lack of structural information, a molecular understanding of this lipid-protein interaction remains unresolved.

Specific, OS-induced conformational changes are detected both at the N-terminal domain and within the substrate portal nearly 30 Å away. Combining previously measured kinetic properties in the presence of OS with its impact on the <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> for linoleic acid substrate binding, we conclude that OS binding brings about an increase in rate constants for both the ingress and egress of substrate.

A region at the C-terminus has been shown to be amphiphilic, and by analogy with surface-seeking peptides, may be responsible for interaction of phytochrome with lipid bilayers. Possible targeting sequences in phytochromes have been identified, including a series of four basic residues which correspond to those responsible for transport of nuclear-located proteins. Sites capable of post-translational modification have been found in monocot sequences, but not in dicot sequences. Areas of the phytochrome molecule which are exposed on the surface of the protein, and which are therefore capable of interaction with other cellular macromolecules, have been identified.

23834513,Molecular dynamics simulations of barley and maize lipid transfer proteins show different ligand binding preferences in agreement with experimental data.,"Experimental studies of barley and maize lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) show that the two proteins bind the ligand palmitate in opposite orientations in their internal cavities. Moreover, maize LTP is reported to bind the ligand caprate in the internal cavity in a mixture of two orientations with approximately equal occupancy. Six 30 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of maize and barley LTP with ligands bound in two orientations (modes M and B) have been used to understand the different ligand binding preferences. The simulations show that both maize and barley LTP could bind palmitate in the orientation observed experimentally for maize LTP (mode M), with the predominant interaction being a salt bridge between the ligand carboxylate headgroup and a conserved arginine side chain. However, the simulation of barley LTP with palmitate in the mode B orientation shows the most favorable protein-ligand interaction energy. In contrast, the simulations of maize LTP with palmitate and with caprate in the mode B orientation show no persistent ligand binding, the ligands leaving the cavity during the simulations. Sequence differences between maize and barley LTP in the AB loop region, in residues at the base of the hydrophobic cavity, and in the helix A region are identified as contributing to the different behavior. The simulations reproduce well the experimentally observed binding preferences for palmitate and suggest that the experimental data for maize LTP with caprate reflect ligand mobility in binding mode M rather than the population of binding modes M and B.",10.1021/bi4006573,True,high,True,high,"[""barley"", ""maize""]","[""ligand binding"", ""lipid transfer proteins"", ""fatty acid interactions""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""barley"", ""maize""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Experimental studies of barley and maize lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) show that the two proteins bind the ligand palmitate in opposite orientations in their internal cavities."", ""Moreover, maize LTP is reported to bind the ligand caprate in the internal cavity in a mixture of two orientations with approximately equal occupancy.""], ""explanation"": ""The study examines how lipid transfer proteins from barley and maize interact with fatty acid ligands such as palmitate and caprate, directly addressing lipid binding mechanisms and ligand orientation within the protein cavities."", ""specific_topics"": [""ligand binding"", ""lipid transfer proteins"", ""fatty acid interactions""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",2: Lipid Transport & Trafficking,success,2.0,Lipid Transport & Trafficking
21193581,Composition differences between epicuticular and intracuticular wax substructures: how do plants seal their epidermal surfaces?,"The protective wax coating on plant surfaces has long been considered to be non-uniform in composition at a subcellular scale. In recent years, direct evidence has started to accumulate showing quantitative compositional differences between the epicuticular wax (i.e. wax exterior to cutin that can be mechanically peeled off) and intracuticular wax (i.e. wax residing within the mechanically resistant layer of cutin) layers in particular. This review provides a first synthesis of the results acquired for all the species investigated to date in order to assign chemical information directly to cuticle substructures, together with an overview of the methods used and a discussion of possible mechanisms and biological functions. The development of methods to probe the wax for z-direction heterogeneity began with differential solvent extractions. Further research employing mechanical wax removal by adhesives permitted the separation and analysis of the epicuticular and intracuticular wax. In wild-type plants, the intracuticular (1-30 μg cm(-2)) plus the epicuticular wax (5-30 μg cm(-2)) combined to a total of 8-40 μg cm(-2). Cyclic wax constituents, such as triterpenoids and alkylresorcinols, preferentially or entirely accumulate within the intracuticular layer. Within the very-long-chain aliphatic wax components, primary alcohols tend to accumulate to higher percentages in the intracuticular wax layer, while free fatty acids and alkanes in many cases accumulate in the epicuticular layer. Compounds with different chain lengths are typically distributed evenly between the layers. The mechanism causing the fractionation remains to be elucidated but it seems plausible that it involves, at least in part, spontaneous partitioning due to the physico-chemical properties of the wax compounds and interactions with the intracuticular polymers.

7647684,The characterisation of tapetum-specific cDNAs isolated from a Lilium henryi L. meiocyte subtractive cDNA library.,"Differential screening of a meiocyte subtractive cDNA library from Lilium henryi L. has identified a group of 16 anther-specific partial cDNAs. Three of these sequences, LHM2, LHM6 and LHM7 have been further characterised. Hybridisation in situ with antisense riboprobes of LHM2, LHM6, and LHM7 gives a strong, clear signal which, contrary to expectations, is localised to the tapetal layer surrounding the meiocytes and not the meiocytes themselves. Developmental slot blots demonstrate that mRNAs corresponding to the three LHM cDNAs are transcribed from prophase of meiosis I to the uninucleate microspore stage, while Northern analysis reveals these tapetally expressed cDNAs to correspond with transcripts of some 500 bp. Although LHM2 is less abundant than LHM6 and LHM7, the pattern of developmental expression, and the size range of the transcripts suggests that all three cDNAs may be related. The deduced polypeptide products of LHM6 and LHM7 share 71% identity over a conserved region of 38 residues. Inverse polymerase chain reaction was used to obtain the full sequence for LHM7. Its deduced protein sequence has a signal peptide indicating it may be secreted; the cleaved protein has a molecular weight of 8.9 kDa. Furthermore, the LHM7 protein has significant levels of homology with tapetally expressed proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana, Antirrhinum majus and Lycopersicon esculentum.

CPSAR1 is shown here to be required for the normal organization of mature thylakoid stacks, and ultimately for embryo development. CPSAR1 is a chloroplast protein that has a dual localization in the stroma and the inner envelope membrane, according to microscopy studies and subfractionation analysis. CPSAR1 is close to the Obg nucleotide binding protein subfamily and displays GTPase activity, as demonstrated by in vitro assays. Disruption of the CPSAR1 gene via T-DNA insertion results in the arrest of embryo development. In addition, transmission electron microscopy analysis indicates that mutant embryos are unable to develop thylakoid membranes, and remain white. Unstacked membrane structures resembling single lamellae accumulate in the stroma, and do not assemble into mature thylakoid stacks. CPSAR1 RNA interference induces partially developed thylakoids leading to pale-green embryos. Altogether, the presented data demonstrate that CPSAR1 is a protein essential for the formation of normal thylakoid membranes, and suggest a possible involvement in the initiation of vesicles from the inner envelope membrane for the transfer of lipids to the thylakoids.",10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04225.x,True,high,True,high,,"[""lipid transport"", ""vesicle-mediated lipid transfer"", ""thylakoid membrane biogenesis""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": null, ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""suggest a possible involvement in the initiation of vesicles from the inner envelope membrane for the transfer of lipids to the thylakoids.""], ""explanation"": ""The study proposes that CPSAR1 may participate in vesicle-mediated lipid transfer from the inner envelope membrane to thylakoid membranes, indicating relevance to lipid processes."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid transport"", ""vesicle-mediated lipid transfer"", ""thylakoid membrane biogenesis""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",2: Lipid Transport & Trafficking,success,2.0,Lipid Transport & Trafficking
17077082,Optical manipulation reveals strong attracting forces at membrane contact sites between endoplasmic reticulum and chloroplasts.,"Eukaryote cells depend on membrane lipid trafficking from biogenic membranes, like the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), to other membranes in the cell. Two major routes for membrane lipid transport are recognized: vesicular trafficking and lipid transfer at zones of close contact between membranes. Specific ER regions involved in such membrane contact sites (MCSs) have been isolated, and lipid transfer at MCSs as well as protein-protein interactions between the partaking membranes have been demonstrated (reviewed by Holthuis, J. C. M., and Levine, T. P. (2005) Nat. Rev. 6, 209-220). Here we present the first demonstration of the physical association between membranes involved in MCSs: by using optical imaging and manipulation, strong attracting forces between ER and chloroplasts are revealed. We used Arabidopsis thaliana expressing green fluorescent protein in the ER lumen and observed leaf protoplasts by confocal microscopy. The ER network was evident, with ER branch end points apparently localized at chloroplast surfaces. After rupture of a protoplast using a laser scalpel, the cell content was released. ER fragments remained attached to the released chloroplasts and could be stretched out by optical tweezers. The applied force, 400 pN, could not drag a chloroplast free from its attached ER, which could reflect protein-protein interactions at the ER-chloroplast MCSs. As chloroplasts rely on import of ER-synthesized lipids, we propose that lipid transfer occurs at these MCSs. We suggest that lipid transfer at the MCSs also occurs in the opposite direction, for example to channel plastid-synthesized acyl groups to supply substrates for ER-localized synthesis of membrane and storage lipids.",10.1074/jbc.M608124200,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""membrane lipid trafficking"", ""lipid transfer at membrane contact sites"", ""acyl group channeling""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Eukaryote cells depend on membrane lipid trafficking from biogenic membranes, like the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), to other membranes in the cell."", ""As chloroplasts rely on import of ER-synthesized lipids, we propose that lipid transfer occurs at these MCSs."", ""We suggest that lipid transfer at the MCSs also occurs in the opposite direction, for example to channel plastid-synthesized acyl groups to supply substrates for ER-localized synthesis of membrane and storage lipids.""], ""explanation"": ""The study investigates how lipids are trafficked between the endoplasmic reticulum and chloroplasts via membrane contact sites, examining both the physical forces involved and the proposed bidirectional lipid transfer pathways, thereby addressing key aspects of lipid biology."", ""specific_topics"": [""membrane lipid trafficking"", ""lipid transfer at membrane contact sites"", ""acyl group channeling""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",2: Lipid Transport & Trafficking,success,2.0,Lipid Transport & Trafficking

9927639,The Arabidopsis dwf7/ste1 mutant is defective in the delta7 sterol C-5 desaturation step leading to brassinosteroid biosynthesis.,"Lesions in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthetic genes result in characteristic dwarf phenotypes in plants. Understanding the regulation of BR biosynthesis demands continued isolation and characterization of mutants corresponding to the genes involved in BR biosynthesis. Here, we present analysis of a novel BR biosynthetic locus, dwarf7 (dwf7). Feeding studies with BR biosynthetic intermediates and analysis of endogenous levels of BR and sterol biosynthetic intermediates indicate that the defective step in dwf7-1 resides before the production of 24-methylenecholesterol in the sterol biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, results from feeding studies with 13C-labeled mevalonic acid and compactin show that the defective step is specifically the Delta7 sterol C-5 desaturation, suggesting that dwf7 is an allele of the previously cloned STEROL1 (STE1) gene. Sequencing of the STE1 locus in two dwf7 mutants revealed premature stop codons in the first (dwf7-2) and the third (dwf7-1) exons.

29365132,Transcriptional stimulation of rate-limiting components of the autophagic pathway improves plant fitness.,"Autophagy is a major catabolic process whereby autophagosomes deliver cytoplasmic content to the lytic compartment for recycling. Autophagosome formation requires two ubiquitin-like systems conjugating Atg12 with Atg5, and Atg8 with lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), respectively. Genetic suppression of these systems causes autophagy-deficient phenotypes with reduced fitness and longevity. We show that Atg5 and the E1-like enzyme, Atg7, are rate-limiting components of Atg8-PE conjugation in Arabidopsis. Overexpression of ATG5 or ATG7 stimulates Atg8 lipidation, autophagosome formation, and autophagic flux. It also induces transcriptional changes opposite to those observed in atg5 and atg7 mutants, favoring stress resistance and growth. As a result, ATG5- or ATG7-overexpressing plants exhibit increased resistance to necrotrophic pathogens and oxidative stress, delayed aging and enhanced growth, seed set, and seed oil content.

They encoded proteins involved in lipid metabolism, defense, envelope-related functions, or cuticle biosynthesis and include ZmWBC11a (for white brown complex 11a), an ortholog of AtWBC11 involved in the transport of wax and cutin molecules. In support of the annotations, OCL1-overexpressing plants showed quantitative and qualitative changes of cuticular wax compounds in comparison with wild-type plants. An increase in C24 to C28 alcohols was correlated with the transcriptional up-regulation of ZmFAR1, coding for a fatty acyl-coenzyme A reductase. Transcriptional activation of ZmWBC11a by OCL1 was likely direct, since transactivation in transiently transformed maize kernels was abolished by a deletion of the activation domain in OCL1 or mutations in the L1 box, a cis-element bound by HD-ZIP IV transcription factors. Our data demonstrate that, in addition to AP2/EREBP and MYB-type transcription factors, members of the HD-ZIP IV family contribute to the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in cuticle biosynthesis.",10.1104/pp.109.150540,True,high,True,high,"[""Zea mays""]","[""lipid metabolism"", ""cuticle biosynthesis"", ""fatty acid synthesis""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Zea mays""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""They encoded proteins involved in lipid metabolism, defense, envelope-related functions, or cuticle biosynthesis and include ZmWBC11a (for white brown complex 11a), an ortholog of AtWBC11 involved in the transport of wax and cutin molecules."", ""An increase in C24 to C28 alcohols was correlated with the transcriptional up\u2011regulation of ZmFAR1, coding for a fatty acyl\u2011coenzyme A reductase.""], ""explanation"": ""The study focuses on maize epidermal transcription factor OCL1 and its downstream targets, many of which encode enzymes and transporters directly involved in lipid metabolic pathways, including fatty acid reduction and cuticular wax biosynthesis.

20679226,"Different functions of the C3HC4 zinc RING finger peroxins PEX10, PEX2, and PEX12 in peroxisome formation and matrix protein import.","The integral peroxisomal membrane proteins PEX10, PEX2, and PEX12 contain a zinc RING finger close to the C terminus. Loss of function of these peroxins causes embryo lethality at the heart stage in Arabidopsis. Preventing the coordination of Zn(2+) ions by amino acid substitutions in PEX10, PEX2, and PEX12 and overexpressing the resulting conditional sublethal mutations in WT uncovered additional functions of PEX10. Plants overexpressing DeltaZn-mutant PEX10 display deformed peroxisomal shapes causing diminished contact with chloroplasts and possibly with mitochondria. These changes correlated with impaired metabolite transfer and, at high CO(2), recoverable defective photorespiration plus dwarfish phenotype. The N-terminal PEX10 domain is critical for peroxisome biogenesis and plant development. A point mutation in the highly conserved TLGEEY motif results in vermiform peroxisome shape without impairing organelle contact. Addition of an N-terminal T7 tag to WT PEX0 resulted in partially recoverable reduced growth and defective inflorescences persisting under high CO(2). In contrast, plants overexpressing PEX2-DeltaZn-T7 grow like WT in normal atmosphere, contain normal-shaped peroxisomes, but display impaired peroxisomal matrix protein import. PEX12-DeltaZn-T7 mutants exhibit unimpaired import of matrix protein and normal-shaped peroxisomes when grown in normal atmosphere. During seed germination, glyoxysomes form a reticulum around the lipid bodies for mobilization of storage oil. The formation of this glyoxysomal reticulum seemed to be impaired in PEX10-DeltaZn but not in PEX2-DeltaZn-T7 or PEX12-DeltaZn-T7 plants.

In non-limiting conditions chloroplast development is a highly conserved process, it is also complex and involves the continuous interaction of both chloroplast and nuclear genomes. In the first part of the paper the sequential and structural changes characteristic of chloroplast division and development in angiosperms are described. The synthesis of the major chloroplast components including chlorophylls a and b, lipids, nucleic acids and the major soluble and membrane proteins are then described. Chloroplast development in biochemical terms is a quantitative accretion of additional functional units. In development from proplastid to fully mature chloroplast the molecular changes are almost exclusively quantitative and the youngest plastids that can be analysed are already photochemically fully competent. In the second part of the paper the dominant role of the nuclear genome in chloroplast development is discussed. Recent work in the author's laboratory on the synthesis and accumulation of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase in the developing chloroplasts of young wheat leaves is cited to illustrate the stable genomic and genotypic differences that can be recognized.

Both dG50-LA-HP and dG50-LA-AP complexes showed B + V hybrid crystalline structures, but mainly V-type for dG50-LA-AP and apparently B + V-type for dG50-LA-HP. Besides, those two type complexes significantly decreased starch digestibility, and the dG50-LA-HP changed in a higher magnitude since dG50-LA-HP contained more compact and ordered aggregates. The different starch assembly behavior under synergistic effect of hydrothermal treatment and LA complexation combined with different pressure should be responsible for the variation in starch digestibility.

18303110,Genetic evidence for the role of isopentenyl diphosphate isomerases in the mevalonate pathway and plant development in Arabidopsis.,"Isopentenyl/dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase (IPI) catalyzes the interconversion of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), which are the universal C(5) units of isoprenoids. In plants, IPP and DMAPP are synthesized via the cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) and plastidic methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways, respectively. However, the role of IPI in each pathway and in plant development is unknown due to a lack of genetic studies using IPI-defective mutants. Here, we show that the atipi1atipi2 double mutant, which is defective in two Arabidopsis IPI isozymes, exhibits dwarfism and male sterility under long-day conditions and decreased pigmentation under continuous light, whereas the atipi1 and atipi2 single mutants are phenotypically normal. We also show that the sterol and ubiquinone levels in the double mutant are <50% of those in wild-type plants, and that the male-sterile phenotype is chemically complemented by squalene, a sterol precursor. In vivo isotope labeling experiments using the atipi1atipi2 double mutant revealed a decrease in the incorporation of MVA (in its lactone form) into sterols, with no decrease in the incorporation of MEP pathway intermediates into tocopherol. These results demonstrate a critical role for IPI in isoprenoid biosynthesis via the MVA pathway, and they imply that IPI is essential for the maintenance of appropriate levels of IPP and DMAPP in different subcellular compartments in plants.",10.1093/pcp/pcn032,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""sterol biosynthesis"", ""isoprenoid metabolism""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""The sterol and ubiquinone levels in the double mutant are <50% of those in wild\u2011type plants."", ""In vivo isotope labeling experiments using the atipi1atipi2 double mutant revealed a decrease in the incorporation of MVA (in its lactone form) into sterols, with no decrease in the incorporation of MEP pathway intermediates into tocopherol.""], ""explanation"": ""The study quantifies sterol and ubiquinone concentrations and tracks their synthesis through isotopic labeling, directly addressing lipid biosynthetic pathways and their regulation in plants."", ""specific_topics"": [""sterol biosynthesis"", ""isoprenoid metabolism""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",3: Lipid Metabolism,success,3.0,Lipid Metabolism

In order to investigate additive and/or synergistic effect(s) on the phytosterol content of barley chromosomes, we used a series of barley chromosome addition lines of common wheat that were produced by normal crossing. In determining the plant sterol levels in 2-week-old seedlings and dry seeds, we found that the level of stigmasterol in the barley chromosome 3 addition (3H) line in the seedlings was 1.5-fold higher than that in the original wheat line and in the other barley chromosome addition lines, but not in the seeds. Simultaneously, we determined the overall expression pattern of genes related to plant sterol biosynthesis in the seedlings of wheat and each addition line to assess the relative expression of each gene in the sterol pathway. Since we elucidated the CYP710A8 (cytochrome P450 subfamily)-encoding sterol C-22 desaturase as a key characteristic for the higher level of stigmasterol, full-length cDNAs of wheat and barley CYP710A8 genes were isolated. These CYP710A8 genes were mapped on chromosome 3 in barley (3H) and wheat (3A, 3B, and 3D), and the expression of CYP710A8 genes increased in the 3H addition line, indicating that it is responsible for stigmasterol accumulation.

25869652,The Arabidopsis MYB96 Transcription Factor Is a Positive Regulator of ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE4 in the Control of Seed Germination.,"Seed germination is a key developmental transition that initiates the plant life cycle. The timing of germination is determined by the coordinated action of two phytohormones, gibberellin and abscisic acid (ABA). In particular, ABA plays a key role in integrating environmental information and inhibiting the germination process. The utilization of embryonic lipid reserves contributes to seed germination by acting as an energy source, and ABA suppresses lipid degradation to modulate the germination process. Here, we report that the ABA-responsive R2R3-type MYB transcription factor MYB96, which is highly expressed in embryo, regulates seed germination by controlling the expression of abscisic acid-insensitive4 (ABI4) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In the presence of ABA, germination was accelerated in MYB96-deficient myb96-1 seeds, whereas the process was significantly delayed in MYB96-overexpressing activation-tagging myb96-ox seeds. Consistently, myb96-1 seeds degraded a larger extent of lipid reserves even in the presence of ABA, while reduced lipid mobilization was observed in myb96-ox seeds. MYB96 directly regulates ABI4, which acts as a repressor of lipid breakdown, to define its spatial and temporal expression. Genetic analysis further demonstrated that ABI4 is epistatic to MYB96 in the control of seed germination. Taken together, the MYB96-ABI4 module regulates lipid mobilization specifically in the embryo to ensure proper seed germination under suboptimal conditions.",10.1104/pp.15.00162,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""lipid mobilization"", ""lipid degradation"", ""lipid reserves""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""The utilization of embryonic lipid reserves contributes to seed germination by acting as an energy source, and ABA suppresses lipid degradation to modulate the germination process."", ""myb96-1 seeds degraded a larger extent of lipid reserves even in the presence of ABA, while reduced lipid mobilization was observed in myb96-ox seeds.""], ""explanation"": ""The paper studies how the transcription factor MYB96 influences lipid mobilization during seed germination, linking hormone signaling to the regulation of lipid breakdown."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid mobilization"", ""lipid degradation"", ""lipid reserves""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",3: Lipid Metabolism,success,3.0,Lipid Metabolism

23934749,Crystal structures of α-dioxygenase from Oryza sativa: insights into substrate binding and activation by hydrogen peroxide.,"α-Dioxygenases (α-DOX) are heme-containing enzymes found predominantly in plants and fungi, where they generate oxylipins in response to pathogen attack. α-DOX oxygenate a variety of 14-20 carbon fatty acids containing up to three unsaturated bonds through stereoselective removal of the pro-R hydrogen from the α-carbon by a tyrosyl radical generated via the oxidation of the heme moiety by hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ). We determined the X-ray crystal structures of wild type α-DOX from Oryza sativa, the wild type enzyme in complex with H2 O2 , and the catalytically inactive Y379F mutant in complex with the fatty acid palmitic acid (PA). PA binds within the active site cleft of α-DOX such that the carboxylate forms ionic interactions with His-311 and Arg-559. Thr-316 aids in the positioning of carbon-2 for hydrogen abstraction. Twenty-five of the twenty eight contacts made between PA and residues lining the active site occur within the carboxylate and first eight carbons, indicating that interactions within this region of the substrate are responsible for governing selectivity. Comparison of the wild type and H2 O2 structures provides insight into enzyme activation. The binding of H2 O2 at the distal face of the heme displaces residues His-157, Asp-158, and Trp-159 ≈ 2.5 Å from their positions in the wild type structure. As a result, the Oδ2 atom of Asp-158 interacts with the Ca atom in the calcium binding loop, the side chains of Trp-159 and Trp-213 reorient, and the guanidinium group of Arg-559 is repositioned near Tyr-379, poised to interact with the carboxylate group of the substrate.",10.1002/pro.2327,True,high,True,high,"[""Oryza sativa""]","[""fatty acid metabolism"", ""lipid oxidation"", ""oxylipin biosynthesis""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Oryza sativa""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""\u03b1-DOX oxygenate a variety of 14\u201120 carbon fatty acids containing up to three unsaturated bonds through stereoselective removal of the pro\u2011R hydrogen from the \u03b1\u2011carbon by a tyrosyl radical generated via the oxidation of the heme moiety by hydrogen peroxide (H\u2082O\u2082)."", ""The catalytically inactive Y379F mutant in complex with the fatty acid palmitic acid (PA).""], ""explanation"": ""The study examines how the rice \u03b1\u2011dioxygenase enzyme binds and oxidizes fatty acids, specifically palmitic acid, revealing details about lipid substrate recognition and enzymatic processing."", ""specific_topics"": [""fatty acid metabolism"", ""lipid oxidation"", ""oxylipin biosynthesis""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",3: Lipid Metabolism,success,3.0,Lipid Metabolism
26079999,Active Site Dynamical Effects in the Hydrogen Transfer Rate-limiting Step in the Catalysis of Linoleic Acid by Soybean Lipoxygenase-1 (SLO-1): Primary and Secondary Isotope Contributions.,"Using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations that facilitate the treatment of rare events, we probe the active site participation in the rate-determining hydrogen transfer step in the catalytic oxidation of linoleic acid by soybean lipoxygenase-1 (SLO-1). The role of two different active site components is probed. (a) On the hydrogen atom acceptor side of the active site, the hydrogen bonding propensity between the acceptor side hydroxyl group, which is bound to the iron cofactor, and the backbone carboxyl group of isoleucine (residue number 839) is studied toward its role in promoting the hydrogen transfer event. Primary and secondary (H/D) isotope effects are also probed and a definite correlation with subtle secondary H/D isotope effects is found. With increasing average nuclear kinetic energy, the increase in transfer probability is enhanced due to the presence of the hydrogen bond between the backbone carbonyl of I839 and the acceptor oxygen. Further increase in average nuclear kinetic energy reduces the strength of this secondary hydrogen bond which leads to a deterioration in hydrogen transfer rates and finally embrances an Arrhenius-like behavior. (b) On the hydrogen atom donor side, the coupling between vibrational modes predominantly localized on the donor-side linoleic acid group and the reactive mode is probed. There appears to be a qualitative difference in the coupling between modes that belong to linoleic acid and the hydrogen transfer mode, for hydrogen and deuterium transfer. For example, the donor side secondary hydrogen atom is much more labile (by nearly a factor of 5) during deuterium transfer as compared to the case for hydrogen transfer. This appears to indicate a greater coupling between the modes belonging to the linoleic acid scaffold and the deuterium transfer mode and also provides a new rationalization for the abnormal (nonclassical) secondary isotope effect results obtained by Knapp, Rickert, and Klinman in J. Am. Chem. Soc. , 2002 , 124 , 3865 . To substantiate our findings noted in point a above, we have suggested an I839 → A839 or I839 → V839 mutation.

40627726,MTS1 regulates rice plant architecture by mediating phosphoinositide metabolism.,"Plant architecture is an agronomically important trait affecting grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Here, we identified a gene, Moderate-tillering and Semi-dwarf 1 (MTS1), which encodes a type II Inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (5PTase). Compared to the wild type, the mts1 mutant exhibited a significant reduction in plant height and an increase in effective tiller number. Further analysis showed that the mutation in MTS1 impairs the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2], resulting in its aberrant accumulation and subsequent suppression of actin polymerization. Notably, the mutation in MTS1 specifically affects the response to gibberellin at the reproductive growth stage. Both lipid-protein overlay assay and microscale thermophoresis assay demonstrated that phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) interacts with NGR5. PI4P promotes NGR5 degradation, thereby modulating plant architecture. Investigation of yield-related traits showed that the mts1 mutant has a similar grain yield per plant to the wild type due to the compensation effect of increasing effective tiller number.

17389070,The characterization and differentiation of higher plants by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.,"Several techniques have been used to identify and classify plants. We proposed Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, together with hierarchical cluster analysis, as a rapid and noninvasive technique to differentiate plants based on their leaf fragments. We applied this technique to three different genera, namely, Ranunculus (Ranunculaceae), Acantholimon (Plumbaginaceae), and Astragalus (Leguminoseae). All of these genera are angiosperms and include a large number of species in Turkey. Ranunculus and Acantholimon have ornamental importance, while Astragalus is an important pharmaceutical genus. The FT-IR spectra revealed dramatic differences, which indicated the variations in lipid metabolism, carbohydrate composition, and protein conformation of the genera. Moreover, cell wall polysaccharides including diverse groups could be identified for each genus. Acantholimon was found to have the highest hydrogen capacity in its polysaccharide and proteins. A higher lignin content and a lower occurrence of decarboxylation and pectin esterification reactions were appointed for Ranunculus and Astragalus compared to Acantholimon. All these results suggested that FT-IR spectroscopy can be successfully applied to differentiate genera, as demonstrated here with Ranunculus, Astragalus, and Acantholimon. In addition, we used this technique to identify the same species from different geographical regions. In conclusion, the current FT-IR study presents a novel method for rapid and accurate molecular characterization and identification of plants based on the compositional and structural differences in their macromolecules.",10.1366/000370207780220903,True,high,True,high,"[""Ranunculus"", ""Acantholimon"", ""Astragalus""]","[""lipid metabolism""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Ranunculus"", ""Acantholimon"", ""Astragalus""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""The FT\u2011IR spectra revealed dramatic differences, which indicated the variations in lipid metabolism, carbohydrate composition, and protein conformation of the genera.""], ""explanation"": ""The study explicitly discusses variations in lipid metabolism detected via FT\u2011IR spectroscopy, indicating that lipid-related processes are central to the research."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid metabolism""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",3: Lipid Metabolism,success,3.0,Lipid Metabolism
22988098,Completion of the core β-oxidative pathway of benzoic acid biosynthesis in plants.,"Despite the importance of benzoic acid (BA) as a precursor for a wide array of primary and secondary metabolites, its biosynthesis in plants has not been fully elucidated. BA formation from phenylalanine requires shortening of the C(3) side chain by two carbon units, which can occur by a non-β-oxidative route and/or a β-oxidative pathway analogous to the catabolism of fatty acids. Enzymes responsible for the first and last reactions of the core BA β-oxidative pathway (cinnamic acid → cinnamoyl-CoA → 3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoyl-CoA → 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoyl-CoA → BA-CoA) have previously been characterized in petunia, a plant with flowers rich in phenylpropanoid/benzenoid volatile compounds. Using a functional genomics approach, we have identified a petunia gene encoding cinnamoyl-CoA hydratase-dehydrogenase (PhCHD), a bifunctional peroxisomal enzyme responsible for two consecutively occurring unexplored intermediate steps in the core BA β-oxidative pathway. PhCHD spatially, developmentally, and temporally coexpresses with known genes in the BA β-oxidative pathway, and correlates with emission of benzenoid volatiles. Kinetic analysis of recombinant PhCHD revealed it most efficiently converts cinnamoyl-CoA to 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoyl-CoA, thus forming the substrate for the final step in the pathway. Down-regulation of PhCHD expression in petunia flowers resulted in reduced CHD enzyme activity, as well as decreased formation of BA-CoA, BA and their derived volatiles. Moreover, transgenic lines accumulated the PhCHD substrate cinnamoyl-CoA and the upstream pathway intermediate cinnamic acid. Discovery of PhCHD completes the elucidation of the core BA β-oxidative route in plants, and together with the previously characterized CoA-ligase and thiolase enzymes, provides evidence that the whole pathway occurs in peroxisomes.",10.1073/pnas.1211001109,True,high,True,high,"[""Petunia""]","[""\u03b2\u2011oxidation"", ""peroxisomal lipid metabolism""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Petunia""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""BA formation from phenylalanine requires shortening of the C(3) side chain by two carbon units, which can occur by a non\u2011\u03b2\u2011oxidative route and/or a \u03b2\u2011oxidative pathway analogous to the catabolism of fatty acids."", ""Using a functional genomics approach, we have identified a petunia gene encoding cinnamoyl\u2011CoA hydratase\u2011dehydrogenase (PhCHD), a bifunctional peroxisomal enzyme responsible for two consecutively occurring unexplored intermediate steps in the core BA \u03b2\u2011oxidative pathway.""], ""explanation"": ""The manuscript describes a \u03b2\u2011oxidative pathway that operates analogously to fatty\u2011acid catabolism within peroxisomes, involving enzymes such as hydratase\u2011dehydrogenase, CoA\u2011ligase, and thiolase.

20159849,Jasmonate biochemical pathway.,"Plants possess a family of potent fatty acid-derived wound-response and developmental regulators: the jasmonates. These compounds are derived from the tri-unsaturated fatty acids alpha-linolenic acid (18:3) and, in plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana and tomato, 7(Z)-, 10(Z)-, and 13(Z)-hexadecatrienoic acid (16:3). The lipoxygenase-catalyzed addition of molecular oxygen to alpha-linolenic acid initiates jasmonate synthesis by providing a 13-hydroperoxide substrate for formation of an unstable allene oxide by allene oxide synthase (AOS). This allene oxide then undergoes enzyme-guided cyclization to produce 12-oxophytodienoic acid (OPDA). These first steps take place in plastids, but further OPDA metabolism occurs in peroxisomes. OPDA has several fates, including esterification into plastid lipids and transformation into the 12-carbon prohormone jasmonic acid (JA). JA is itself a substrate for further diverse modifications, including the production of jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile), which is a major biologically active jasmonate among a growing number of jasmonate derivatives. Each new jasmonate family member that is discovered provides another key to understanding the fine control of gene expression in immune responses; in the initiation and maintenance of long-distance signal transfer in response to wounding; in the regulation of fertility; and in the turnover, inactivation, and sequestration of jasmonates, among other processes.",10.1126/scisignal.3109cm3,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana"", ""tomato""]","[""fatty acid metabolism"", ""lipoxygenase pathway"", ""jasmonate biosynthesis""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana"", ""tomato""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Plants possess a family of potent fatty acid-derived wound-response and developmental regulators: the jasmonates."", ""These compounds are derived from the tri\u2011unsaturated fatty acids alpha\u2011linolenic acid (18:3) and, in plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana and tomato, 7(Z)-, 10(Z)-, and 13(Z)-hexadecatrienoic acid (16:3).""], ""explanation"": ""The study focuses on jasmonate biosynthesis, which originates from fatty acids via lipoxygenase-mediated oxidation, indicating direct investigation of fatty acid-derived lipids and their metabolic pathways."", ""specific_topics"": [""fatty acid metabolism"", ""lipoxygenase pathway"", ""jasmonate biosynthesis""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",3: Lipid Metabolism,success,3.0,Lipid Metabolism
18326559,Divinyl ether synthesis in garlic bulbs.,"Formation of 13-lipoxygenase-derived divinyl ethers has been described in garlic bulbs. Here, the identification of a cDNA from garlic is described, which encodes for an enzyme that corresponds to divinyl ether synthases (DES). The recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and shown to metabolize 13-hydroperoxy as well as 9-hydroperoxy linole(n)ic acid to etherole(n)ic and colnele(n)ic acid, respectively. This biochemical feature classifies it as a member of the CYP74C subfamily of cytochrome P-450 enzymes. Product analysis after incubation of purified recombinant enzyme and fatty acid hydroperoxides revealed the formation of a mixture of different cis/trans isomers with one isomer often dominant. RNA blot analyses showed a constitutive expression of DES transcripts predominant in below-ground organs of garlic. By exogenous application of salicylic acid and sorbitol, but not by methyljasmonate, the transcript was also induced in leaves. Whereas the prominent divinyl ether in garlic was the 13-lipoxygenase-derived etheroleic acid, analysis of transgenic Arabidopsis expressing garlic DES showed that 9-lipoxygenase-derived colnelenic acid dominated 24 h after wounding. These data indicate that the product pattern of this DES from garlic depends on the substrate availability and that the enzyme is the first member in the group of 9/13-DES.",10.1093/jxb/ern010,True,high,True,high,"[""Allium sativum""]","[""lipoxygenase pathway"", ""cytochrome P\u2011450 enzymes"", ""divinyl ether synthesis""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Allium sativum""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Formation of 13-lipoxygenase-derived divinyl ethers has been described in garlic bulbs."", ""Product analysis after incubation of purified recombinant enzyme and fatty acid hydroperoxides revealed the formation of a mixture of different cis/trans isomers with one isomer often dominant.""], ""explanation"": ""The study characterizes a garlic enzyme that converts fatty acid hydroperoxides (products of lipoxygenase activity) into divinyl ether compounds, thereby investigating lipid metabolic pathways involving fatty acids and cytochrome P\u2011450 enzymes."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipoxygenase pathway"", ""cytochrome P\u2011450 enzymes"", ""divinyl ether synthesis""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",3: Lipid Metabolism,success,3.0,Lipid Metabolism
1869550,Structural requirements for transformation of substrates by the (S)-adenosyl-L-methionine:delta 24(25)-sterol methyl transferase.,"The membrane-bound enzyme of microsomes obtained from sunflower embryos that catalyzes the bi-substrate transfer reaction whereby the methyl group of (S)-adenosyl-L-methionine is transferred to C-24 of the sterol side chain has been investigated. Optimal incubation conditions for assay of the microsomal (S)-adenosyl-L-methionine:sterol delta 24-methyl transferase (SMT) have been established for the first time. The microsomal preparation was found to catalyze the formation of a delta 24(28)-sterol and to be free of contaminating methyl transferase enzymes, e.g. those which form delta 23-24 methyl sterols (cyclosadol) and delta 25-24 beta-methyl sterols (cyclolaudenol) and other sterolic enzymes which might transform the acceptor molecule to metabolites which could compete in the assay with the test substrate. From a series of incubations with 27 sterol and sterol-like (triterpenoids) substrates of which 23 compounds possessed a 24,25-double bond, we observed a marked dependence on precise structural features and three-dimensional shape of the acceptor molecule in its ability to be transformed by the SMT. In contrast to the yeast SMT where cycloartenol fails to bind to the SMT and zymosterol is the best substrate for methylation, the sunflower SMT studied here utilizes cycloartenol preferentially to zymosterol and the other substrates. Of the chemical groups which distinguishes cycloartenol, a free 3 beta-OH,9 beta,19-cyclopropyl group, trimethylated saturated nucleus, and delta 24-double bond, only the nucleophilic centers at C-3 and C-24 were obligatory for substrate binding and methylation. Of the bent or flat conformations which cycloartenol may orient in the enzyme-substrate complex, our results indicate a selection for acceptor molecules which possess the shape that closely resembles the crystal state and solution orientation of cycloartenol which is now known to be flat rather than bent (Nes, W.

Dietary phytosterols are important because they can lower blood cholesterol levels. Previously, the overexpression of Brassica juncea wild-type (wt) and mutant (S359A) BjHMGS1 in Arabidopsis up-regulated several genes in sterol biosynthesis and increased sterol content. Recombinant S359A had earlier displayed a 10-fold higher in vitro enzyme activity. Furthermore, tobacco HMGS overexpressors (OEs) exhibited improved sterol content, plant growth and seed yield. Increased growth and seed yield in tobacco OE-S359A over OE-wtBjHMGS1 coincided with elevations in NtSQS expression and sterol content.

Using 11R-(3)H- and 11S-(3)H-labeled linoleic acid substrates to examine the initial hydrogen abstraction, we found that all the primary hydroperoxide products were formed with an identical and highly stereoselective pro-S hydrogen abstraction from C-11 of the substrate (97-99% pro-S-selective). This strongly suggests that 9R and 13S oxygenations occur with the same binding orientation of substrate in the active site, and as the equivalent 9R and 13S products were formed from a bulky ester derivative (1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoylphosphatidylcholine), one can infer that the orientation is tail-first. Both the EPR spectrum and the reaction kinetics were altered by the R product-inducing Ala-Gly mutation, indicating a substantial influence of this Ala-Gly substitution extending to the environment of the active site iron. To examine also the reversed orientation of substrate binding, we studied oxygenation of the 15S-hydroperoxide of arachidonic acid by the Ala542Gly mutant soybean LOX-1. In addition to the usual 5S, 15S- and 8S, 15S-dihydroperoxides, a new product was formed and identified by high-performance liquid chromatography, UV, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and NMR as 9R, 15S-dihydroperoxyeicosa-5Z,7E,11Z,13E-tetraenoic acid, the R configuration ""partner"" of the normal 5S,15S product.

Absolute suberin amounts related to root length significantly increased from primary ECWs (Casparian strips) to secondary ECWs (suberin lamella). During further maturation of the endodermis, reaching the final tertiary developmental state characterised by the deposition of lignified secondary cell walls (u-shaped cell wall deposits), suberin amounts remained constant. Absolute amounts of lignin related to root length constantly increased throughout the change from primary to tertiary ECWs. The suberin of Casparian strips contained high amounts of carboxylic and 2-hydroxy acids, and differed substantially from the suberin of secondary and tertiary ECWs, which was dominated by high contents of omega-hydroxycarboxylic and 1,omega-dicarboxylic acids. Furthermore, the chain-length distribution of suberin monomers in primary ECWs ranged from C(16) to C(24), whereas in secondary and tertiary ECWs a shift towards higher chain lengths (C(16) to C(28)) was observed. The lignin composition of Casparian strips (primary ECWs) showed a high syringyl content and was similar to lignin in secondary cell walls of the tertiary ECWs, whereas lignin in secondary ECWs contained higher amounts of p-hydroxyphenyl units. The suberin and lignin compositions of RHCWs rarely changed with increasing root age. However, compared to the suberin in ECWs, where C(16) and C(18) were the most prominent chain lengths, the suberin of RHCWs was dominated by the higher chain lengths (C(24) and C(26)).

The desaturase enzymes utilized the complex lipid substrate phosphatidylcholine. The activity of these enzymes was sufficiently high to allow the monitoring of the mass changes in the endogenous oleate, linoleate and gamma-linolenate in the microsomal phosphatidylcholine in the presence of NADH (i.e. under desaturating conditions). The results illustrate that the delta 12-desaturase uses the oleate substrate at both the sn-1 and -2 positions of sn-phosphatidylcholine, whereas the delta 6-desaturase is almost totally restricted to the linoleate at position 2 of the complex lipid. Estimate of the acyl-substrate pool size at position 2 of sn-phosphatidylcholine for both desaturases indicated that some 50% of the oleate and linoleate was available to the enzymes.

However, stereochemical analysis of the acyl components of the sn-triacylglycerol obtained from mature seeds indicated that, whereas no gamma-linolenate was present at the sn-1 position, it accounted for over 50% of the fatty acids at position sn-3. The results indicate that the diacylglycerol acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.20) may show a strong selectivity for gamma-linolenoyl-CoA and hence result in the efficient removal of this fatty acid from the acyl-CoA pool in vivo, leaving negligible substrate for utilization by the sn-glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.15).",10.1042/bj2520641,True,high,True,high,"[""Borago officinalis""]","[""fatty acid desaturation"", ""phosphatidylcholine metabolism"", ""triacylglycerol biosynthesis""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Borago officinalis""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Microsomal membrane preparations from the maturing cotyledons of common borage (Borago officinalis) exhibit delta 12- and delta 6-desaturase activities, which resulted in the synthesis of linoleate and gamma-linolenate respectively."", ""The desaturase enzymes utilized the complex lipid substrate phosphatidylcholine.""], ""explanation"": ""The study characterizes enzymatic activities (delta\u201112 and delta\u20116 desaturases) that modify fatty acids within phosphatidylcholine, monitors changes in fatty acid composition, and examines downstream effects on triacylglycerol synthesis, all of which directly involve lipid biochemistry."", ""specific_topics"": [""fatty acid desaturation"", ""phosphatidylcholine metabolism"", ""triacylglycerol biosynthesis""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",3: Lipid Metabolism,success,3.0,Lipid Metabolism

Oxylipins include the phytohormone, jasmonic acid, and a number of other molecules including hydroxy-, oxo- or keto-fatty acids or volatile aldehydes that may perform various biological roles as second messengers, messengers in inter-organismic signaling, or even as bactericidal agents. The structural diversity of oxylipins is further increased by esterification of the compounds in plastidial glycolipids, for instance the Arabidopsides, or by conjugation of oxylipins to amino acids or other metabolites. The enzymes involved in oxylipin metabolism are diverse and comprise a multitude of examples with interesting and unusual catalytic properties.

Furthermore, starch-free mutants with impaired PXA1 function showed the phenotype more quickly, indicating a link between energy metabolism and beta-oxidation.

How these proteins are lipoylated has been extensively studied in prokaryotes and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), but little is known for plants. We earlier reported that mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis by ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase is not vital for protein lipoylation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and does not play a significant role in roots.

The octanoate-activating enzyme is unknown, but we assume that it uses octanoyl moieties provided by mitochondrial β-oxidation. AtLPLA is essential for the octanoylation of PDH-E2, whereas GDC H-protein can optionally also be octanoylated by octanoyltransferase (LIP2) using octanoyl chains provided by mitochondrial ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase to meet the high lipoate requirement of leaf mesophyll mitochondria. Similar to protein lipoylation in yeast, LIP2 likely also transfers octanoyl groups attached to the H-protein to KGDH-E2 but not to PDH-E2, which is exclusively octanoylated by LPLA.

26276842,"Overexpression of Arabidopsis Ceramide Synthases Differentially Affects Growth, Sphingolipid Metabolism, Programmed Cell Death, and Mycotoxin Resistance.","Ceramide synthases catalyze an N-acyltransferase reaction using fatty acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and long-chain base (LCB) substrates to form the sphingolipid ceramide backbone and are targets for inhibition by the mycotoxin fumonisin B1 (FB1). Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) contains three genes encoding ceramide synthases with distinct substrate specificities: LONGEVITY ASSURANCE GENE ONE HOMOLOG1 (LOH1; At3g25540)- and LOH3 (At1g19260)-encoded ceramide synthases use very-long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and trihydroxy LCB substrates, and LOH2 (At3g19260)-encoded ceramide synthase uses palmitoyl-CoA and dihydroxy LCB substrates. In this study, complementary DNAs for each gene were overexpressed to determine the role of individual isoforms in physiology and sphingolipid metabolism. Differences were observed in growth resulting from LOH1 and LOH3 overexpression compared with LOH2 overexpression. LOH1- and LOH3-overexpressing plants had enhanced biomass relative to wild-type plants, due in part to increased cell division, suggesting that enhanced synthesis of very-long-chain fatty acid/trihydroxy LCB ceramides promotes cell division and growth. Conversely, LOH2 overexpression resulted in dwarfing. LOH2 overexpression also resulted in the accumulation of sphingolipids with C16 fatty acid/dihydroxy LCB ceramides, constitutive induction of programmed cell death, and accumulation of salicylic acid, closely mimicking phenotypes observed previously in LCB C-4 hydroxylase mutants defective in trihydroxy LCB synthesis. In addition, LOH2- and LOH3-overexpressing plants acquired increased resistance to FB1, whereas LOH1-overexpressing plants showed no increase in FB1 resistance, compared with wild-type plants, indicating that LOH1 ceramide synthase is most strongly inhibited by FB1.

20699392,Phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase 1 and 2 regulate phospholipid synthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum in Arabidopsis.,"Phospholipid biosynthesis is essential for the construction of most eukaryotic cell membranes, but how this process is regulated in plants remains poorly understood. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis thaliana, two Mg(2+)-dependent phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolases called PAH1 and PAH2 act redundantly to repress phospholipid biosynthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Leaves from pah1 pah2 double mutants contain ~1.8-fold more phospholipid than the wild type and exhibit gross changes in ER morphology, which are consistent with massive membrane overexpansion. The net rate of incorporation of [methyl-(14)C]choline into phosphatidylcholine (PC) is ~1.8-fold greater in the double mutant, and the transcript abundance of several key genes that encode enzymes involved in phospholipid synthesis is increased. In particular, we show that PHOSPHORYLETHANOLAMINE N-METHYLTRANSFERASE1 (PEAMT1) is upregulated at the level of transcription in pah1 pah2 leaves. PEAMT catalyzes the first committed step of choline synthesis in Arabidopsis and defines a variant pathway for PC synthesis not found in yeasts or mammals. Our data suggest that PAH1/2 play a regulatory role in phospholipid synthesis that is analogous to that described in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

On the day of anthesis the cotton fibre initial cells balloon out from the ovule surface and so are clearly distinguished from adjacent epidermal pavement cells. To enhance our understanding of the molecular processes that determine which cells become fibres and why adjacent epidermal cells remain in a different developmental state we studied the expression profiles of the two respective cell types. Using laser-capture microdissection, coupled with an in vitro RNA amplification system, we used cDNA microarray slides to profile the gene expression in expanding fibre initials compared to the non-expanding epidermal cells at an early stage just after the fibre initials are discernable.

However, it has yet to be established whether specific combinations of these genes can be used to achieve an additive effect and whether this leads to enhanced yield. Using Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) as an experimental system, we show that seed-specific overexpression of WRINKLED1 (a transcriptional regulator of glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis) and DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1 (a triacylglycerol biosynthetic enzyme) combined with suppression of the triacylglycerol lipase SUGAR-DEPENDENT1 results in a higher percentage seed oil content and greater seed mass than manipulation of each gene individually.

At a low concentration of xanthan gum (<0.5wt%), the viscous characteristics of the filled starch hydrogels increased. Furthermore, these hydrogels had a slower rate of lipid digestion than the β-carotene-loaded emulsion. As the concentration of xanthan gum was increased (to 1.0wt% and 2.0wt%), the filled starch hydrogels became more elastic gel-like than those without xanthan gum, and also had the fastest rate and highest final extent of lipid digestion. The addition of xanthan gum to the filled starch hydrogel lowered the bioaccessibility of β-carotene to varying degrees, depending on the xanthan gum concentration.

17917299,Chemical phenotypes of the hmg1 and hmg2 mutants of Arabidopsis demonstrate the in-planta role of HMG-CoA reductase in triterpene biosynthesis.,"Plants produce a wide variety of cyclic triterpenes, such as sterols and triterpenoids, which are the major products of the mevalonate (MVA) pathway. It is important to understand the physiological functions of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) because HMGR is the rate-limiting enzyme in the MVA pathway. We have previously isolated Arabidopsis mutants in HMG1 and HMG2. Although the biochemical function of HMGR2 has been thought to be almost equal to that of HMGR1, based on similarities in their sequences, the phenotypes of mutants in these genes are quite different. Whereas hmg2 shows no abnormal phenotype under normal growth conditions, hmg1 shows pleiotropic phenotypes, including dwarfing, early senescence, and male sterility. We previously postulated that the 50% decrease in the sterol content of hmg1, as compared to that in the wild type, was a cause of these phenotypes, but comprehensive triterpene profiles of these mutants had not yet been determined. Here, we present the triterpene profiles of hmg1 and hmg2. In contrast to hmg1, hmg2 showed a sterol content 15% lower than that of the wild type. A precise triterpenoid quantification using synthesized deuterated compounds of beta-amyrin (1), alpha-amyrin (2), and lupeol (3) showed that the levels of triterpenoids in hmg1 and hmg2 were 65% and 25% lower than in the wild type (WT), respectively.

23632854,A chloroplast ABC1-like kinase regulates vitamin E metabolism in Arabidopsis.,"In bacteria and mitochondria, ABC1 (for Activity of bc1 complex)-like kinases regulate ubiquinone synthesis, mutations causing severe respiration defects, including neurological disorders in humans. Little is known about plant ABC1-like kinases; in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), five are predicted in mitochondria but, surprisingly, six are located at lipid droplets in chloroplasts. These are a known site of prenylquinone (including tocopherol [vitamin E], phylloquinone [vitamin K] and plastoquinone) metabolism and contain a large proportion of the tocopherol cyclase (VTE1) required for vitamin E synthesis and recycling. Therefore, ABC1-like kinases may be involved in the regulation of chloroplast prenylquinone metabolism. Using a nontargeted lipidomics approach, we demonstrate that plants lacking the plastoglobule ABC1-like kinase ABC1K3 are defective both for the production of plastochromanol-8 (a plastoquinone-derived lipid antioxidant) and the redox recycling of α-tocopherol, whereas tocopherol production is not affected. All of these pathways require VTE1 activity. However, in the abc1k3 mutant, VTE1 levels are strongly reduced posttranscriptionally. We provide evidence that the ABC1-like kinase ABC1K3 phosphorylates VTE1, possibly stabilizing it at plastoglobules.

21257189,Cationic substrates of soybean lipoxygenase-1.,"Soybean lipoxygenase-1 (SBLO-1) catalyzes the oxygenation of 1,4-dienes to produce conjugated diene hydroperoxides. The best substrates are anions of fatty acids; for example, linoleate is converted to 13(S)-hydroperoxy-9(Z),11(E)-octadecadienoate. The manner in which SBLO-1 binds substrates is uncertain. In the present work, it was found that SBLO-1 will oxygenate linoleyltrimethylammonium ion (LTMA) to give primarily13(S)-hydroperoxy-9(Z),11(E)-octadecadienyltrimethylammonium ion. The rate of this process is about the same at pH 7 and pH 9 and is about 30% of the rate observed with linoleate at pH 9.

25822663,Unsaturation of very-long-chain ceramides protects plant from hypoxia-induced damages by modulating ethylene signaling in Arabidopsis.,"Lipid remodeling is crucial for hypoxic tolerance in animals, whilst little is known about the hypoxia-induced lipid dynamics in plants. Here we performed a mass spectrometry-based analysis to survey the lipid profiles of Arabidopsis rosettes under various hypoxic conditions. We observed that hypoxia caused a significant increase in total amounts of phosphatidylserine, phosphatidic acid and oxidized lipids, but a decrease in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Particularly, significant gains in the polyunsaturated species of PC, PE and phosphatidylinositol, and losses in their saturated and mono-unsaturated species were evident during hypoxia. Moreover, hypoxia led to a remarkable elevation of ceramides and hydroxyceramides. Disruption of ceramide synthases LOH1, LOH2 and LOH3 enhanced plant sensitivity to dark submergence, but displayed more resistance to submergence under light than wild type. Consistently, levels of unsaturated very-long-chain (VLC) ceramide species (22:1, 24:1 and 26:1) predominantly declined in the loh1, loh2 and loh3 mutants under dark submergence. In contrast, significant reduction of VLC ceramides in the loh1-1 loh3-1 knockdown double mutant and lacking of VLC unsaturated ceramides in the ads2 mutants impaired plant tolerance to both dark and light submergences. Evidence that C24:1-ceramide interacted with recombinant CTR1 protein and inhibited its kinase activity in vitro, enhanced ER-to-nucleus translocation of EIN2-GFP and stabilization of EIN3-GFP in vivo, suggests a role of ceramides in modulating CTR1-mediated ethylene signaling. The dark submergence-sensitive phenotypes of loh mutants were rescued by a ctr1-1 mutation. Thus, our findings demonstrate that unsaturation of VLC ceramides is a protective strategy for hypoxic tolerance in Arabidopsis.",10.1371/journal.pgen.1005143,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""lipid remodeling"", ""ceramide metabolism"", ""ethylene signaling""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Here we performed a mass spectrometry-based analysis to survey the lipid profiles of Arabidopsis rosettes under various hypoxic conditions."", ""We observed that hypoxia caused a significant increase in total amounts of phosphatidylserine, phosphatidic acid and oxidized lipids, but a decrease in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE).""], ""explanation"": ""The study explicitly measures changes in multiple lipid classes, including phospholipids and ceramides, using mass spectrometry, indicating a direct investigation into lipid composition and metabolism."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid remodeling"", ""ceramide metabolism"", ""ethylene signaling""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",4: Lipid Signaling,success,4.0,Lipid Signaling
27193303,Two-ligand priming mechanism for potentiated phosphoinositide synthesis is an evolutionarily conserved feature of Sec14-like phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine exchange proteins.,"Lipid signaling, particularly phosphoinositide signaling, plays a key role in regulating the extreme polarized membrane growth that drives root hair development in plants. The Arabidopsis AtSFH1 gene encodes a two-domain protein with an amino-terminal Sec14-like phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP) domain linked to a carboxy-terminal nodulin domain. AtSfh1 is critical for promoting the spatially highly organized phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate signaling program required for establishment and maintenance of polarized root hair growth. Here we demonstrate that, like the yeast Sec14, the AtSfh1 PITP domain requires both its phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns)- and phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho)-binding properties to stimulate PtdIns-4-phosphate [PtdIns(4)P] synthesis. Moreover, we show that both phospholipid-binding activities are essential for AtSfh1 activity in supporting polarized root hair growth. Finally, we report genetic and biochemical evidence that the two-ligand mechanism for potentiation of PtdIns 4-OH kinase activity is a broadly conserved feature of plant Sec14-nodulin proteins, and that this strategy appeared only late in plant evolution. Taken together, the data indicate that the PtdIns/PtdCho-exchange mechanism for stimulated PtdIns(4)P synthesis either arose independently during evolution in yeast and in higher plants, or a suitable genetic module was introduced to higher plants from a fungal source and subsequently exploited by them.",10.1091/mbc.E16-04-0221,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""phosphatidylinositol transfer"", ""phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate synthesis"", ""root hair polarization""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Lipid signaling, particularly phosphoinositide signaling, plays a key role in regulating the extreme polarized membrane growth that drives root hair development in plants."", ""Here we demonstrate that, like the yeast Sec14, the AtSfh1 PITP domain requires both its phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns)- and phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho)-binding properties to stimulate PtdIns-4-phosphate [PtdIns(4)P] synthesis.""], ""explanation"": ""The study focuses on phospholipid interactions and phosphoinositide metabolism, central aspects of lipid biology, within the context of plant root hair development."", ""specific_topics"": [""phosphatidylinositol transfer"", ""phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate synthesis"", ""root hair polarization""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",4: Lipid Signaling,success,4.0,Lipid Signaling

19363154,Phosphoinositide-dependent regulation of VAN3 ARF-GAP localization and activity essential for vascular tissue continuity in plants.,"ACAP-type ARF GTPase activating proteins (ARF-GAPs) regulate multiple cellular processes, including endocytosis, secretion, phagocytosis, cell adhesion and cell migration. However, the regulation of ACAP functions by other cellular proteins is poorly understood. We have reported previously that a plant ACAP, VAN3, plays a pivotal role in plant venation continuity. Here, we report on newly identified VAN3 regulators: the CVP2 (cotyledon vascular pattern 2) 5 PTase, which is considered to degrade IP(3) and also to produce PtdIns(4)P from PtdIns(4,5)P(2); and a PH domain-containing protein, VAB (VAN3 binding protein). Combinational mutations of both CVP2 and its closest homologue CVL1 (CVP2 like 1) phenocopied the strong allele of van3 mutants, showing severe vascular continuity. The phenotype of double mutants between van3, cvp2 and vab suggested that VAN3, CVP2 and VAB function in vascular pattern formation in the same pathway. Localization analysis revealed that both CVP2 and VAB colocalize with VAN3 in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), supporting their functions in the same pathway. The subcellular localization of VAN3 was dependent on its PH domain, and mislocalization of VAN3 was induced in cvp2 or vab mutants. These results suggest that CVP2 and VAB cooperatively regulate the subcellular localization of VAN3 through the interaction between its PH domain and phosphoinositides and/or inositol phosphates. In addition, PtdIns(4)P, to which VAN3 binds preferentially, enhanced the ARF-GAP activity of VAN3, whereas IP(3) inhibited it. These results suggest the existence of PtdIns(4)P and/or IP(3)-dependent subcellular targeting and regulation of VAN3 ACAP activity that governs plant vascular tissue continuity.",10.1242/dev.030098,True,high,True,high,,"[""phosphoinositide signaling"", ""ARF\u2011GAP regulation"", ""vascular tissue continuity""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": null, ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""These results suggest that CVP2 and VAB cooperatively regulate the subcellular localization of VAN3 through the interaction between its PH domain and phosphoinositides and/or inositol phosphates."", ""In addition, PtdIns(4)P, to which VAN3 binds preferentially, enhanced the ARF\u2011GAP activity of VAN3, whereas IP(3) inhibited it.""], ""explanation"": ""The study focuses on how phosphoinositides such as PtdIns(4)P and IP(3) interact with the PH domain of VAN3 to modulate its localization and ARF\u2011GAP enzymatic activity, directly linking lipid signaling to vascular development."", ""specific_topics"": [""phosphoinositide signaling"", ""ARF\u2011GAP regulation"", ""vascular tissue continuity""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",4: Lipid Signaling,success,4.0,Lipid Signaling
18282190,Phosphatidylinositol kinases as regulators of GA-stimulated alpha-amylase secretion in barley (Hordeum vulgare).,"Phosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol, in association with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 kinase, EC 2.7.1.137) and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4 kinase, EC 2.7.1.67), play a key role in regulation of fundamental cell processes. We present evidence for a relationship between alpha-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) secretion regulated by GA and levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) in barley (Hordeum vulgare). Microsomal membranes were incubated in the presence of [gamma-(32)P]ATP, and radiolabeled membrane lipids were extracted and separated by TLC using a boric acid system. Treatment of aleurone layers with GA for short or long periods of time increased PI4 kinase activity. To evaluate the effect of PtdIns(4)P levels on GA signaling, we used phenylarsine oxide (PAO), an inhibitor of PI4 kinase activity. PAO reversibly reduced the alpha-amylase secretion and protoplast cell vacuolation in a dose-dependent manner. Wortmannin showed a similar inhibitory effect on alpha-amylase secretion and PI4 kinase activity. GA evoked only a long-term increase in PI3 kinase activity, which was also affected by PAO. The effect of PAO was suppressed by the reducing agent 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol (BAL), leading to restoration of secretion, vacuolation and PI4 kinase activity. In contrast, the effect of PAO on PI3 kinase activity was not abolished by BAL, suggesting that PI3 kinase is not involved in the secretion process. Likewise, the compound LY294002 inhibited PI3 kinase but had no effect on the secretion process.

In this study, maize immature zygotic embryos were used to generate embryogenic (EC) and non-embryogenic (NEC) calli. In order to compare proteomes of EC and NEC, two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) in combination with mass spectrometry was used. This approach resulted into 361 quantified 2-DE spots out of which 44 were found statistically significantly differentially abundant between EC and NEC. Mass spectrometry provided the identity for 23 proteins that were classified into 8 metabolic categories. The most abundant were proteins associated with energy followed by proteins associated with disease and defense. Based on the abundances of identified proteins in this and other studies, working model for plant totipotency was proposed. One aspect of this working model suggests that increased abundances of proteins associated with pyruvate biosynthesis and suppression of embryogenic genes might be responsible for differences between EC and NEC cells. Furthermore we speculate that the increased abundance of lipoxygenase in the NEC cells results in changes in the equilibrium levels of one or more signaling molecules and is at least partly responsible for somatic cell reprogramming during totipotency.

19473329,A rapid wound signal activates the systemic synthesis of bioactive jasmonates in Arabidopsis.,"Jasmonic acid (JA) and its biologically active derivatives (bioactive JAs) perform a critical role in regulating plant responses to wound stress. The perception of bioactive JAs by the F-box protein COI1 triggers the SCF(COI1)/ubiquitin-dependent degradation of JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN (JAZ) proteins that repress the expression of JA-response genes. JA is required for many wound-inducible systemic defense responses, but little is known about the role of the hormone in long-distance signal relay between damaged and undamaged leaves. Here, we show that the wounding of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves results in the rapid (<5 min) accumulation of jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine (JA-Ile), the bioactive form of JA, in leaves distal to the wound site. The rapid systemic increase in JA-Ile preceded the onset of early transcriptional responses, and was associated with JAZ degradation. Wound-induced systemic production of JA-Ile required the JA biosynthetic enzyme 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) reductase 3 (OPR3) in undamaged responding leaves, but not in wounded leaves, and was largely dependent on the JA-conjugating enzyme JAR1. Interestingly, the wound-induced synthesis of JA/JA-Ile in systemic leaves was correlated with a rapid decline in OPDA levels. These results are consistent with a model in which a rapidly transmitted wound signal triggers the systemic synthesis of JA, which, upon conversion to JA-Ile, activates the expression of early response genes by the SCF(COI1)/JAZ pathway.",10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03924.x,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""jasmonic acid biosynthesis"", ""lipid\u2011derived signaling""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""The perception of bioactive JAs by the F-box protein COI1 triggers the SCF(COI1)/ubiquitin\u2011dependent degradation of JASMONATE ZIM\u2011DOMAIN (JAZ) proteins that repress the expression of JA\u2011response genes."", ""Wound\u2011induced systemic production of JA\u2011Ile required the JA biosynthetic enzyme 12\u2011oxo\u2011phytodienoic acid (OPDA) reductase 3 (OPR3) in undamaged responding leaves, but not in wounded leaves, and was largely dependent on the JA\u2011conjugating enzyme JAR1.""], ""explanation"": ""Jasmonic acid (JA) and its conjugate JA\u2011Ile are lipid\u2011derived signaling molecules produced via fatty acid oxidation pathways.

In this study, we investigated the effect of ABA on the expression of AtLPP genes as they encode putative ABA-signalling partners. We observed that AtLPP2 expression was down-regulated by ABA and we performed experiments on Atlpp2-2, an AtLPP2 knockout mutant, to determine whether AtLPP2 was involved in ABA signalling. We observed that Atlpp2-2 plantlets contained about twice as much PA as the wild-type Col-0 and exhibited higher PA kinase (PAK) activity than Col-0 plants. In addition, we showed that ABA stimulated diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) activity independently of AtLPP2 activity but that the ABA-stimulation of PAK activity recorded in Col-0 was dependent on AtLPP2. In order to evaluate the involvement of AtLPP2 activity in guard cell function, we measured the ABA sensitivity of Atlpp2-2 stomata. The inhibition of stomatal opening was less sensitive to ABA in Atlpp2-2 than in Col-0. Watered and water-stressed plants of the two genotypes accumulated ABA to the same extent, thus leading us to consider Atlpp2-2 an ABA-signalling mutant.

19304931,Phospholipase D activation is an early component of the salicylic acid signaling pathway in Arabidopsis cell suspensions.,"Salicylic acid (SA) plays a central role in defense against pathogen attack, as well as in germination, flowering, senescence, and the acquisition of thermotolerance. In this report we investigate the involvement of phospholipase D (PLD) in the SA signaling pathway. In presence of exogenous primary alcohols, the production of phosphatidic acid by PLD is diverted toward the formation of phosphatidylalcohols through a reaction called transphosphatidylation. By in vivo metabolic phospholipid labeling with (33)P(i), PLD activity was found to be induced 45 min after addition of SA. We show that incubation of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cell suspensions with primary alcohols inhibited the induction of two SA-responsive genes, PATHOGENESIS-RELATED1 and WRKY38, in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibitory effect was more pronounced when the primary alcohols were more hydrophobic. Secondary or tertiary alcohols had no inhibitory effect. These results provide compelling arguments for PLD activity being upstream of the induction of these genes by SA. A subsequent study of n-butanol effects on the SA-responsive transcriptome identified 1,327 genes differentially expressed upon SA treatment. Strikingly, the SA response of 380 of these genes was inhibited by n-butanol but not by tert-butanol. A detailed analysis of the regulation of these genes showed that PLD could act both positively and negatively, either on gene induction or gene repression.

17766402,N-Acylethanolamine metabolism interacts with abscisic acid signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings.,"N-Acylethanolamines (NAEs) are bioactive acylamides that are present in a wide range of organisms. In plants, NAEs are generally elevated in desiccated seeds, suggesting that they may play a role in seed physiology. NAE and abscisic acid (ABA) levels were depleted during seed germination, and both metabolites inhibited the growth of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings within a similar developmental window. Combined application of low levels of ABA and NAE produced a more dramatic reduction in germination and growth than either compound alone. Transcript profiling and gene expression studies in NAE-treated seedlings revealed elevated transcripts for a number of ABA-responsive genes and genes typically enriched in desiccated seeds. The levels of ABI3 transcripts were inversely associated with NAE-modulated growth. Overexpression of the Arabidopsis NAE degrading enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase resulted in seedlings that were hypersensitive to ABA, whereas the ABA-insensitive mutants, abi1-1, abi2-1, and abi3-1, exhibited reduced sensitivity to NAE. Collectively, our data indicate that an intact ABA signaling pathway is required for NAE action and that NAE may intersect the ABA pathway downstream from ABA.

At young seedling stages, the PIP5K3 and PIP5K4 genes responded to Pi deficiency in steady-state transcript levels via PHR1-binding sequences (P1BSs) in their upstream regions. Both pip5k3 and pip5k4 single mutants, which exhibit short-root-hair phenotypes, remained responsive to Pi deficiency for root hair elongation; however the pip5k3pip5k4 double mutant exhibited shorter root hairs than the single mutants, and lost responsiveness to Pi deficiency at young seedling stages. In the tactical complementation line in which modified PIP5K3 and PIP5K4 genes with base substitutions in their P1BSs were co-introduced into the double mutant, root hairs of young seedlings had normal lengths under Pi-sufficient conditions, but were not responsive to Pi deficiency. From these results, we conclude that a Pi-deficiency signal is transferred to the pathway for root hair elongation via the PIP5K genes.",10.1111/tpj.12741,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""phosphoinositide signaling"", ""lipid-mediated root hair elongation""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""we investigated the expression of type-B phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5\u2011kinase (PIP5K) genes, as a quantitative factor for root hair elongation in Arabidopsis."", ""From these results, we conclude that a Pi\u2011deficiency signal is transferred to the pathway for root hair elongation via the PIP5K genes.""], ""explanation"": ""The study examines phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5\u2011kinase enzymes, key components of phosphoinositide lipid signaling pathways that regulate root hair elongation under phosphate deficiency."", ""specific_topics"": [""phosphoinositide signaling"", ""lipid-mediated root hair elongation""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",4: Lipid Signaling,success,4.0,Lipid Signaling
16299185,A wound-responsive and phospholipid-regulated maize calcium-dependent protein kinase.,"Using protein sequence data obtained from a calcium- and phospholipid-regulated protein kinase purified from maize (Zea mays), we isolated a cDNA encoding a calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK), which we designated ZmCPK11. The deduced amino acid sequence of ZmCPK11 includes the sequences of all the peptides obtained from the native protein. The ZmCPK11 sequence contains the kinase, autoregulatory, and calmodulin-like domains typical of CDPKs. Transcripts for ZmCPK11 were present in every tested organ of the plant, relatively high in seeds and seedlings and lower in stems, roots, and leaves. In leaves, kinase activity and ZmCPK11 mRNA accumulation were stimulated by wounding. The level of ZmCPK11 is also increased in noninjured neighboring leaves. The results suggest that the maize protein kinase is involved in a systemic response to wounding. Bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase (GST)-ZmCPK11 was catalytically active in a calcium-dependent manner. Like the native enzyme, GST-ZmCPK11 was able to phosphorylate histone III-S and Syntide 2. Phosphorylation of histone was stimulated by phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidic acid, whereas phosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, diolein, and cardiolipin did not increase the enzymatic activity. Autophosphorylation of GST-ZmCPK11 was stimulated by calcium and by phosphatidic acid and, to a lesser extent, by phosphatidylserine. Phosphatidylcholine did not affect autophosphorylation.

By using vte1 mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana, with an insertion in the promoter region of the gene encoding tocopherol cyclase, we demonstrate here for the first time that tocopherol deficiency may alter endogenous phytohormone levels in plants, thereby reducing plant growth and triggering anthocyanin accumulation in leaves. In plants grown under a combination of high light and low temperature conditions to induce anthocyanin accumulation, we evaluated age-dependent changes in tocopherols, indicators of photo-oxidative stress, phytohormone levels, plant growth and anthocyanin levels in wild type and vte1 mutants. These mutants showed lower tocopherol levels, reduced growth and enhanced anthocyanin accumulation compared with the wild type, while both the maximum and relative efficiencies of PSII, chlorophylls, and carotenoids were not significantly altered. Analyses of phytohormone levels revealed that reduced growth and enhanced anthocyanin accumulation in tocopherol-deficient plants were preceded by increased jasmonic acid levels.

The C4 protein is a major symptom determinant in several geminiviruses; however, its regulatory mechanism and molecular function in plant cells remain unclear. Here, we show that BSCTV C4 is S-acylated in planta, and that this post-translational lipid modification is necessary for its membrane localization and functions, especially its regulation of shoot development of host plants. Furthermore, the S-acylated form of C4 interacts with CLAVATA 1 (CLV1), an important receptor kinase in meristem maintenance, and consequentially affects the expression of WUSCHEL, a major target of CLV1. The abnormal development of siliques in Arabidopsis thaliana infected with BSCTV is also dependent on the S-acylation of C4, implying a potential role of CLAVATA signaling in this process.

16880402,Manipulation of Arabidopsis fatty acid amide hydrolase expression modifies plant growth and sensitivity to N-acylethanolamines.,"In vertebrates, the endocannabinoid signaling pathway is an important lipid regulatory pathway that modulates a variety of physiological and behavioral processes. N-Acylethanolamines (NAEs) comprise a group of fatty acid derivatives that function within this pathway, and their signaling activity is terminated by an enzyme called fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which hydrolyzes NAEs to ethanolamine and their corresponding free fatty acids. Bioinformatic approaches led to the identification of plant homologues of FAAH that are capable of hydrolyzing NAEs in vitro. To better understand the role of NAEs in plants, we identified T-DNA knockouts to Arabidopsis FAAH (AtFAAH; At5g64440) and generated plants overexpressing AtFAAH. Here we show that seeds of AtFAAH knockouts had elevated levels of endogenous NAEs, and seedling growth was hypersensitive to exogenously applied NAE. On the other hand, seeds and seedlings of AtFAAH overexpressors had lower endogenous NAE content, and seedlings were less sensitive to exogenous NAE. Moreover, AtFAAH overexpressors displayed enhanced seedling growth and increased cell size. AtFAAH expression and FAAH catalytic activity increased during seed germination and seedling growth, consistent with the timing of NAE depletion during seedling establishment. Collectively, our results show that AtFAAH is one, but not the only, modulator of endogenous NAE levels in plants, and that NAE depletion likely participates in the regulation of plant growth.",10.1073/pnas.0603571103,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis""]","[""fatty acid metabolism"", ""lipid signaling"", ""endocannabinoid-like pathways in plants""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""N-Acylethanolamines (NAEs) comprise a group of fatty acid derivatives that function within this pathway."", ""FAAH ... hydrolyzes NAEs to ethanolamine and their corresponding free fatty acids.""], ""explanation"": ""The study focuses on the enzymatic degradation of N-acylethanolamines, which are fatty acid-derived molecules, thereby directly investigating lipid metabolism and its impact on plant growth."", ""specific_topics"": [""fatty acid metabolism"", ""lipid signaling"", ""endocannabinoid-like pathways in plants""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",4: Lipid Signaling,success,4.0,Lipid Signaling

27932419,Jasmonic Acid Enhances Al-Induced Root Growth Inhibition.,"Phytohormones such as ethylene and auxin are involved in the regulation of the aluminum (Al)-induced root growth inhibition. Although jasmonate (JA) has been reported to play a crucial role in the regulation of root growth and development in response to environmental stresses through interplay with ethylene and auxin, its role in the regulation of root growth response to Al stress is not yet known. In an attempt to elucidate the role of JA, we found that exogenous application of JA enhanced the Al-induced root growth inhibition. Furthermore, phenotype analysis with mutants defective in either JA biosynthesis or signaling suggests that JA is involved in the regulation of Al-induced root growth inhibition. The expression of the JA receptor CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) and the key JA signaling regulator MYC2 was up-regulated in response to Al stress in the root tips. This process together with COI1-mediated Al-induced root growth inhibition under Al stress was controlled by ethylene but not auxin. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that many responsive genes under Al stress were regulated by JA signaling. The differential responsive of microtubule organization-related genes between the wild-type and coi1-2 mutant is consistent with the changed depolymerization of cortical microtubules in coi1 under Al stress. In addition, ALMT-mediated malate exudation and thus Al exclusion from roots in response to Al stress was also regulated by COI1-mediated JA signaling. Together, this study suggests that root growth inhibition is regulated by COI1-mediated JA signaling independent from auxin signaling and provides novel insights into the phytohormone-mediated root growth inhibition in response to Al stress.",10.1104/pp.16.01756,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""jasmonic_acid_signaling"", ""fatty_acid_derivatives""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Although jasmonate (JA) has been reported to play a crucial role in the regulation of root growth and development in response to environmental stresses through interplay with ethylene and auxin, its role in the regulation of root growth response to Al stress is not yet known."", ""The expression of the JA receptor CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) and the key JA signaling regulator MYC2 was up\u2011regulated in response to Al stress in the root tips.""], ""explanation"": ""Jasmonic acid is a fatty\u2011acid\u2013derived phytohormone; the study investigates its signaling pathway and downstream effects, thereby addressing lipid\u2011derived signaling processes."", ""specific_topics"": [""jasmonic_acid_signaling"", ""fatty_acid_derivatives""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",4: Lipid Signaling,success,4.0,Lipid Signaling

Although the cryptogein-sterol complex was suggested to be a form triggering a defense reaction in tobacco, some proteins unable to bind sterols induced the synthesis of active oxygen species and pH changes. The modeling experiments showed that conformational changes after the introduction of bulky residues into the omega loop of cryptogein resemble those induced by sterol binding.

Most multicellular organisms have recruited specific types of lipids and a suite of unique enzymes to catalyze the modification of a select number of proteins, many of which are evolutionarily conserved in plants, animals and fungi. Each of the three known types of lipid modification - palmitoylation, myristylation and prenylation - allows cells to target proteins to the plasma membrane, as well as to other subcellular compartments. Among the lipid modifications, protein prenylation might also function as a relay between cytoplasmic isoprene biosynthesis and regulatory pathways that control cell cycle and growth. Molecular and genetic studies of an Arabidopsis mutant that lacks farnesyl transferase suggest that the enzyme has a role in abscisic acid signaling during seed germination and in the stomata.

In the presence of [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid, phosphorylation of a 55-kDa membrane polypeptide and, to a lesser extent, several others, including a 120-kDa polypeptide, was stimulated by PAF. The phosphorylation of the 55-kDa polypeptide was used for quantification of the PAF-stimulated protein kinase. Stimulation of protein phosphorylation by PAF increased in a concentration range from 10-200 micrograms/ml (= 19-380 microM) PAF up to 10-fold above the control. Addition of Ca2+ ions in the micromolar range in the presence and in the absence of PAF increased the phosphorylation of the 55- and the 120-kDa polypeptide. Other phospholipids and lipids tested including phorbol ester, diglyceride, mono- and triglyceride, and oleic acid were ineffective.

27106783,Reactive Carbonyl Species Activate Caspase-3-Like Protease to Initiate Programmed Cell Death in Plants.,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-triggered programmed cell death (PCD) is a typical plant response to biotic and abiotic stressors. We have recently shown that lipid peroxide-derived reactive carbonyl species (RCS), downstream products of ROS, mediate oxidative signal to initiate PCD. Here we investigated the mechanism by which RCS initiate PCD. Tobacco Bright Yellow-2 cultured cells were treated with acrolein, one of the most potent RCS. Acrolein at 0.2 mM caused PCD in 5 h (i.e. lethal), but at 0.1 mM it did not (sublethal). Specifically, these two doses caused critically different effects on the cells. Both lethal and sublethal doses of acrolein exhausted the cellular glutathione pool in 30 min, while the lethal dose only caused a significant ascorbate decrease and ROS increase in 1-2 h. Prior to such redox changes, we found that acrolein caused significant increases in the activities of caspase-1-like protease (C1LP) and caspase-3-like protease (C3LP), the proteases which trigger PCD. The lethal dose of acrolein increased the C3LP activity 2-fold more than did the sublethal dose. In contrast, C1LP activity increments caused by the two doses were not different. Acrolein and 4-hydroxy-(E)-2-nonenal, another RCS, activated both proteases in a cell-free extract from untreated cells. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at 1 mM added to the cells increased C1LP and C3LP activities and caused PCD, and the RCS scavenger carnosine suppressed their activation and PCD. However, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> did not activate the proteases in a cell-free extract. Thus the activation of caspase-like proteases, particularly C3LP, by RCS is an initial biochemical event in oxidative signal-stimulated PCD in plants.",10.1093/pcp/pcw053,True,high,True,high,"[""Nicotiana tabacum""]","[""lipid peroxidation"", ""reactive carbonyl species"", ""caspase-like protease activation""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Nicotiana tabacum""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""We have recently shown that lipid peroxide-derived reactive carbonyl species (RCS), downstream products of ROS, mediate oxidative signal to initiate PCD."", ""Acrolein and 4-hydroxy-(E)-2-nonenal, another RCS, activated both proteases in a cell-free extract from untreated cells.""], ""explanation"": ""The study investigates the role of lipid peroxide\u2011derived reactive carbonyl species (RCS) in activating caspase\u2011like proteases that trigger programmed cell death in plant cells, thereby focusing on lipid oxidation products and their signaling functions."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid peroxidation"", ""reactive carbonyl species"", ""caspase-like protease activation""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",4: Lipid Signaling,success,4.0,Lipid Signaling
16333570,"Differential effects of two phospholipase D inhibitors, 1-butanol and N-acylethanolamine, on in vivo cytoskeletal organization and Arabidopsis seedling growth.","Plant development is regulated by numerous chemicals derived from a multitude of metabolic pathways. However, we know very little about the biological effects and functions of many of these metabolites in the cell. N-Acylethanolamines (NAEs) are a group of lipid mediators that play important roles in mammalian physiology. Despite the intriguing similarities between animals and plants in NAE metabolism and perception, not much is known about the precise function of these metabolites in plant physiology. In plants, NAEs have been shown to inhibit phospholipase Dalpha (PLDalpha) activity, interfere with abscisic acid-induced stomatal closure, and retard Arabidopsis seedling development. 1-Butanol, an antagonist of PLD-dependent phosphatidic acid production, was reported to induce defects in Arabidopsis seedling development that were somewhat similar to effects induced by elevated levels of NAE. This raised the possibility that the impact of NAE on seedling growth could be mediated in part via its influence on PLD activity. To begin to address this possibility, we conducted a detailed, comparative analysis of the effects of 1-butanol and N-lauroylethanolamine (NAE 12:0) on Arabidopsis root cell division, in vivo cytoskeletal organization, seed germination, and seedling growth. Although both NAE 12:0 and 1-butanol induced profound cytoskeletal and morphological alterations in seedlings, there were distinct differences in their overall effects. 1-Butanol induced more pronounced modifications in cytoskeletal organization, seedling growth, and cell division at concentrations severalfold higher than NAE 12:0.

Here we show that manipulation of the non-specific phospholipase C1, NPC1, alters silicon content in nodes and husks of rice (Oryza sativa). Silicon content in NPC1-overexpressing (OE) plants was decreased in nodes but increased in husks compared to wild-type, whereas RNAi suppression of NPC1 resulted in the opposite changes to those of NPC1-OE plants. NPC1 from rice hydrolyzed phospholipids and galactolipids to generate diacylglycerol that can be phosphorylated to phosphatidic acid. Phosphatidic acid interacts with Lsi6, a silicon transporter that is expressed at the highest level in nodes. In addition, the node cells of NPC1-OE plants have lower contents of cellulose and hemicellulose, and thinner sclerenchyma and vascular bundle fibre cells than wild-type plants; whereas NPC1-RNAi plants displayed the opposite changes.

14749490,Significance of the lipid phase in the dynamics and functions of the xanthophyll cycle as revealed by PsbS overexpression in tobacco and in-vitro de-epoxidation in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol micelles.,"The dynamics of the xanthophyll cycle relative to non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) were examined in tobacco plants overexpressing violaxanthin de-epoxidase (VDE), PsbS and PsbS+VDE for effects on NPQ and violaxanthin (V) de-epoxidation over a range of light intensities. Induction of de-epoxidation and NPQ increased in overexpressed VDE and PsbS plants, respectively. Surprisingly, under low light, overexpressing PsbS enhanced de-epoxidation in addition to NPQ. The effect was hypothesized as due to PsbS binding zeaxanthin (Z) or inducing the binding of Z within the quenching complex, thus shifting the equilibrium toward higher de-epoxidation states. Studies in model systems show that Z can stereospecifically inhibit VDE activity against violaxanthin. This effect, observed under conditions of limiting lipid concentration, was interpreted as product feedback inhibition. These results support the hypothesis that the capacity of the thylakoid lipid phase for xanthophylls is limited and modulates xanthophyll-cycle activity, in conjunction with the release of V and binding of Z by pigment-binding proteins.

17286821,Role of light and jasmonic acid signaling in regulating foliar phloem cell wall ingrowth development.,"Phloem cells adjacent to sieve elements can possess wall invaginations. The role of light and jasmonic acid signaling in wall ingrowth development was examined in pea companion cells (CCs), Arabidopsis thaliana phloem parenchyma cells (PCs), and in Senecio vulgaris (with ingrowths in both cell types). Features characterized included wall ingrowths (from electron microscopic images), foliar vein density and photosynthetic capacity. In Arabidopsis, wall ingrowths were bulky compared with finger-like invaginations in pea and S. vulgaris. Relative to low light (LL), wall invagination in both CCs and PCs was greater in high light (HL). Treatment with methyl jasmonate in LL had no effect on CCs, but increased PC wall ingrowths. LL-to-HL transfer resulted in significantly less wall ingrowth in the fad7-1 fad8-1 (jasmonate-deficient) Arabidopsis mutant relative to the wild type. These results suggest that chloroplast oxidative status, via chloroplast-derived jasmonates, may modulate phloem structure and function. While CC wall ingrowths facilitate phloem loading by expanding the membrane area available for active uptake, one can speculate that phloem PC ingrowths may have two potential roles: to increase the efflux of sugars and/or protons into the apoplast to augment phloem loading; and/or to protect the phloem against pathogens and/or insects.",10.1111/j.1469-8137.2006.01954.x,True,high,True,high,"[""pea"", ""Arabidopsis thaliana"", ""Senecio vulgaris""]","[""jasmonic acid signaling"", ""lipid\u2011derived hormone"", ""fatty acid derivative""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""pea"", ""Arabidopsis thaliana"", ""Senecio vulgaris""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Treatment with methyl jasmonate in LL had no effect on CCs, but increased PC wall ingrowths."", ""LL-to-HL transfer resulted in significantly less wall ingrowth in the fad7-1 fad8-1 (jasmonate\u2011deficient) Arabidopsis mutant relative to the wild type.""], ""explanation"": ""The study investigates jasmonic acid (a lipid\u2011derived hormone) signaling and uses jasmonate\u2011deficient mutants, indicating focus on a lipid\u2010derived signaling pathway rather than general fatty acid or lipid metabolism."", ""specific_topics"": [""jasmonic acid signaling"", ""lipid\u2011derived hormone"", ""fatty acid derivative""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",4: Lipid Signaling,success,4.0,Lipid Signaling
27140440,A role for jasmonates in the release of dormancy by cold stratification in wheat.,"Hydration at low temperatures, commonly referred to as cold stratification, is widely used for releasing dormancy and triggering germination in a wide range of species including wheat. However, the molecular mechanism that underlies its effect on germination has largely remained unknown. Our previous studies showed that methyl-jasmonate, a derivative of jasmonic acid (JA), promotes dormancy release in wheat. In this study, we found that cold-stimulated germination of dormant grains correlated with a transient increase in JA content and expression of JA biosynthesis genes in the dormant embryos after transfer to 20 (o)C. The induction of JA production was dependent on the extent of cold imbibition and precedes germination. Blocking JA biosynthesis with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) inhibited the cold-stimulated germination in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, we have explored the relationship between JA and abscisic acid (ABA), a well-known dormancy promoter, in cold regulation of dormancy. We found an inverse relationship between JA and ABA content in dormant wheat embryos following stratification. ABA content decreased rapidly in response to stratification, and the decrease was reversed by addition of ASA. Our results indicate that the action of JA on cold-stratified grains is mediated by suppression of two key ABA biosynthesis genes, TaNCED1 and TaNCED2.",10.1093/jxb/erw172,True,high,True,high,"[""wheat""]","[""jasmonate biosynthesis"", ""cold stratification"", ""seed dormancy release""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""wheat""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Our previous studies showed that methyl-jasmonate, a derivative of jasmonic acid (JA), promotes dormancy release in wheat."", ""In this study, we found that cold-stimulated germination of dormant grains correlated with a transient increase in JA content and expression of JA biosynthesis genes in the dormant embryos after transfer to 20 (o)C.""], ""explanation"": ""The study examines jasmonate (JA) biosynthesis and signaling pathways, which are derived from fatty acid precursors and represent a lipid-mediated regulatory mechanism affecting seed dormancy and germination."", ""specific_topics"": [""jasmonate biosynthesis"", ""cold stratification"", ""seed dormancy release""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",4: Lipid Signaling,success,4.0,Lipid Signaling

15040888,DNA chip-based expression profile analysis indicates involvement of the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway in multiple plant responses to hormone and abiotic treatments.,"The phosphatidylinositol (PI) metabolic pathway is considered critical in plant responses to many environmental factors, and previous studies have indicated the involvement of multiple PI-related gene families during cellular responses. Through a detailed analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, 82 polypeptides were identified as being involved in PI signaling. These could be grouped into different families including PI synthases (PIS), PI-phosphate kinases (PIPK), phospholipases (PL), inositol polyphosphate phosphatases (IPPase), inositol polyphosphate kinases (IPK), PI transfer proteins and putative inositol polyphosphate receptors. The presence of more than 10 isoforms of PIPK, PLC, PLD and IPPase suggested that these genes might be differentially expressed during plant cellular responses or growth and development. Accordingly, DNA chip technology was employed to study the expression patterns of various isoforms. In total, 79 mRNA clones were amplified and used for DNA chip generation. Expression profile analysis was performed using samples that represented multiple tissues or cellular responses. Tested samples included normal leaf, stem and flower tissues, and leaves from plants treated with various hormones (auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin, abscisic acid and brassinosteroid) or environmental factors (temperature, calcium, sodium, drought, salicylic acid and jasmonic acid). Results showed that many PI pathway-related genes were differentially expressed under these experimental conditions. In particular, the different isoforms of each family were specifically expressed in many cases, suggesting their involvement in tissue specificity and cellular responses to environmental conditions.

19876644,A novel regulatory system in plants involving medium-chain fatty acids.,"Polyethylene glycol sorbitan monoacylates (Tween) are detergents of widespread use in plant sciences. However, little is known about the plant response to these compounds. Interestingly, the structure of Tweens' detergents (especially from Tween 20) resembles the lipid A structure from gram-negative bacteria polysaccharides (a backbone with short saturated fatty acids). Thus, different assays (microarray, GC-MS, RT-PCR, Northern blots, alkalinization and mutant analyses) were conducted in order to elucidate physiological changes in the plant response to Tween 20 detergent. Tween 20 causes a rapid and complex change in transcript abundance which bears all characteristics of a pathogenesis-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)/elicitor-induced defense response, and they do so at concentrations which cause no detectable deleterious effects on plant cellular integrity. In the present work, it is shown that the PAMP/elicitor-induced defense responses are caused by medium-chain fatty acids which are efficiently released from the Tween backbone by the plant, notably lauric acid (12:0) and methyl lauric acid.

19052153,"Phosphatidylinositol (4,5)bisphosphate inhibits K+-efflux channel activity in NT1 tobacco cultured cells.","In the animal world, the regulation of ion channels by phosphoinositides (PIs) has been investigated extensively, demonstrating a wide range of channels controlled by phosphatidylinositol (4,5)bisphosphate (PtdInsP2). To understand PI regulation of plant ion channels, we examined the in planta effect of PtdInsP2 on the K+-efflux channel of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), NtORK (outward-rectifying K channel). We applied a patch clamp in the whole-cell configuration (with fixed ""cytosolic"" Ca2+ concentration and pH) to protoplasts isolated from cultured tobacco cells with genetically manipulated plasma membrane levels of PtdInsP2 and cellular inositol (1,4,5)trisphosphate: ""Low PIs"" had depressed levels of these PIs, and ""High PIs"" had elevated levels relative to controls. In all of these cells, K channel activity, reflected in the net, steady-state outward K+ currents (IK), was inversely related to the plasma membrane PtdInsP2 level. Consistent with this, short-term manipulations decreasing PtdInsP2 levels in the High PIs, such as pretreatment with the phytohormone abscisic acid (25 microM) or neutralizing the bath solution from pH 5.6 to pH 7, increased IK (i.e. NtORK activity). Moreover, increasing PtdInsP2 levels in controls or in abscisic acid-treated high-PI cells, using the specific PI-phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 (2.5-4 microM), decreased NtORK activity.

26537563,Protein S-Acyltransferase 14: A Specific Role for Palmitoylation in Leaf Senescence in Arabidopsis.,"The Asp-His-His-Cys-Cys-rich domain-containing Protein S-Acyl Transferases (PATs) are multipass transmembrane proteins that catalyze S-acylation (commonly known as S-palmitoylation), the reversible posttranslational lipid modification of proteins. Palmitoylation enhances the hydrophobicity of proteins, contributes to their membrane association, and plays roles in protein trafficking and signaling. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), there are at least 24 PATs; previous studies on two PATs established important roles in growth, development, and stress responses. In this study, we identified a, to our knowledge, novel PAT, AtPAT14, in Arabidopsis. Complementation studies in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and Arabidopsis demonstrate that AtPAT14 possesses PAT enzyme activity. Disruption of AtPAT14 by T-DNA insertion resulted in an accelerated senescence phenotype. This coincided with increased transcript levels of some senescence-specific and pathogen-resistant marker genes. We show that early senescence of pat14 does not involve the signaling molecules jasmonic acid and abscisic acid, or autophagy, but associates with salicylic acid homeostasis and signaling. This strongly suggests that AtPAT14 plays a pivotal role in regulating senescence via salicylic acid pathways. Senescence is a complex process required for normal plant growth and development and requires the coordination of many genes and signaling pathways. However, precocious senescence results in loss of biomass and seed production. The negative regulation of leaf senescence by AtPAT14 in Arabidopsis highlights, to our knowledge for the first time, a specific role for palmitoylation in leaf senescence.",10.1104/pp.15.00448,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""palmitoylation"", ""protein lipid modification"", ""fatty acid attachment""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""The Asp-His-His-Cys-Cys-rich domain-containing Protein S-Acyl Transferases (PATs) are multipass transmembrane proteins that catalyze S-acylation (commonly known as S-palmitoylation), the reversible posttranslational lipid modification of proteins."", ""Palmitoylation enhances the hydrophobicity of proteins, contributes to their membrane association, and plays roles in protein trafficking and signaling.""], ""explanation"": ""The study investigates PAT enzymes that attach palmitate, a fatty acid, to proteins\u2014a central lipid modification influencing protein localization and signaling."", ""specific_topics"": [""palmitoylation"", ""protein lipid modification"", ""fatty acid attachment""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",4: Lipid Signaling,success,4.0,Lipid Signaling
12430028,Jasmonate is involved in the induction of tyrosine aminotransferase and tocopherol biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"Coronatine-inducible tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT), which catalyses the transamination from tyrosine to p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, is the first enzyme of a pathway leading via homogentisic acid to plastoquinone and tocopherols, the latter of which are known to be radical scavengers in plants. TAT can be also induced by the octadecanoids methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and methyl-12-oxophytodienoic acid (MeOPDA), as well as by wounding, high light, UV light and the herbicide oxyfluorfen. In order to elucidate the role of octadecanoids in the process of TAT induction in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh., the jasmonate-deficient mutant delayed dehiscence (dde1) was used, in which the gene for 12-oxophytodienoic acid reductase 3 is disrupted. The amount of immunodetectable TAT was low. The enzyme was still fully induced by coronatine as well as by MeJA although induction by the latter was to a lesser extent and later than in the wild type. Treatment with MeOPDA, wounding and UV light, however, had hardly any effects. Tocopherol levels that showed considerable increases in the wild type after some treatments were much less affected in the mutant. However, starting levels of tocopherol were higher in non-induced dde1 than in the wild type.

The 5'-upstream regions of these genes were isolated to study the regulatory elements involved in coordinating tomlox gene expression. Sequence analysis of the promoters did not reveal any previously characterized regulatory elements except for TATA and CAAT boxes. However, the sequence motif GATAcAnnAAtnTGATG was found in both promoters. Chimeric gene fusions of each tomlox promoter with the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene (gus) were introduced into tobacco and tomato plants via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. GUS activity in tomloxA-gus plants during seed germination peaked at day 5 and was enhanced by methyl jasmonate (MeJa) treatment. No GUS activity was detected in tomloxB-gus seedlings. Neither wounding nor abscisic acid (ABA) treatment of transgenic seedlings modified the activity of either promoter. During fruit development, GUS expression in tomloxA-gus tobacco fruit increased 5 days after anthesis (DAA) and peaked at 20 DAA. In tomloxB-gus tobacco fruit, GUS activity increased at 10 DAA and peaked at 20 DAA. In transgenic tomato fruit, tomloxA-gus expression was localized to the outer pericarp during fruit ripening, while tomloxB-gus expression was localized in the outer pericarp and columella.

In this review, we focus on phosphoglycerolipids that are mediators in hormone signal transduction in plants. We first describe the structures of the main signalling phosphoglycerolipids and the metabolic pathways that generate them, namely the phospholipase and lipid kinase pathways. In silico analysis of Arabidopsis transcriptome data provides evidence that the genes encoding the enzymes of these pathways are transcriptionally regulated in responses to hormones, suggesting some link with hormone signal transduction. The involvement of phosphoglycerolipid signalling in the early responses to abscisic acid, salicylic acid and auxins is then detailed. One of the most important signalling lipids in plants is phosphatidic acid. It can activate or inactivate protein kinases and/or protein phosphatases involved in hormone signalling. It can also activate NADPH oxidase leading to the production of reactive oxygen species. We will interrogate the mechanisms that allow the activation/deactivation of the lipid pathways, in particular the roles of G proteins and calcium.

23011567,Chemical and genetic exploration of jasmonate biosynthesis and signaling paths.,"Jasmonates are lipid-derived compounds that act as signals in plant stress responses and developmental processes. Enzymes participating in biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA) and components of JA signaling have been extensively characterized by biochemical and molecular-genetic tools. Mutants have helped to define the pathway for synthesis of jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile), the bioactive form of JA, and to identify the F-box protein COI1 as central regulatory unit. Details on the molecular mechanism of JA signaling were recently unraveled by the discovery of JAZ proteins that together with the adaptor protein NINJA and the general co-repressor TOPLESS form a transcriptional repressor complex. The current model of JA perception and signaling implies the SCF(COI1) complex operating as E3 ubiquitin ligase that upon binding of JA-Ile targets JAZ proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome pathway, thereby allowing MYC2 and other transcription factors to activate gene expression. Chemical strategies, as integral part of jasmonate research, have helped the establishment of structure-activity relationships and the discovery of (+)-7-iso-JA-L-Ile as the major bioactive form of the hormone. The transient nature of its accumulation highlights the need to understand catabolism and inactivation of JA-Ile and recent studies indicate that oxidation of JA-Ile by cytochrome P450 monooxygenase is the major mechanism for turning JA signaling off. Plants contain numerous JA metabolites, which may have pronounced and differential bioactivity.

29330904,Testing a chemical series inspired by plant stress oxylipin signalling agents for herbicide safening activity.,"Herbicide safening in cereals is linked to a rapid xenobiotic response (XR), involving the induction of glutathione transferases (GSTs). The XR is also invoked by oxidized fatty acids (oxylipins) released during plant stress, suggesting a link between these signalling agents and safening. To examine this relationship, a series of compounds modelled on the oxylipins 12-oxophytodienoic acid and phytoprostane 1, varying in lipophilicity and electrophilicity, were synthesized. Compounds were then tested for their ability to invoke the XR in Arabidopsis and protect rice seedlings exposed to the herbicide pretilachlor, as compared with the safener fenclorim. Of the 21 compounds tested, three invoked the rapid GST induction associated with fenclorim. All compounds possessed two electrophilic carbon centres and a lipophilic group characteristic of both oxylipins and fenclorim. Minor effects observed in protecting rice seedlings from herbicide damage positively correlated with the XR, but did not provide functional safening. The design of safeners based on the characteristics of oxylipins proved successful in deriving compounds that invoke a rapid XR in Arabidopsis but not in providing classical safening in a cereal.

An Arabidopsis cytochrome p450 monooxygenase encoded by CYP72B1 has been implicated in brassinosteroid catabolism as well as photomorphogenesis. We expressed CYP72B1 in yeast, coupled with brassinosteroid feeding, and established the biochemical function to be the hydroxylation of BL and castasterone, to give 26-hydroxybrassinolide and 26-hydroxycastasterone, respectively. Brassinosteroid feeding experiments with wild-type Arabidopsis, a CYP72B1 null mutant, and a CYP72B1 overexpression line demonstrated that carbon 26 hydroxylation of active brassinosteroids is an endogenous function of CYP72B1. Seedling growth assays demonstrated that 26-hydroxybrassinolide is an inactive brassinosteroid. Genetic and physiological analysis of the hypocotyl response to exogenous BL and varying intensities of white and monochromatic light suggested that CYP72B1 modulates photomorphogenesis primarily through far-red light and to a lesser extent through blue- and red-light pathways. CYP72B1 transcript accumulation in dark-grown seedlings was organ specific and down-regulated after 1 h of illumination in dim white, red, and blue light, but not far-red light. CYP72B1 translational fusions with the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene demonstrated that protein levels increased in the hypocotyl elongation zone when shifted from the dark to far-red light, but not blue or red light. We propose a model in which Arabidopsis seedling development switches from dark-grown development (skotomorphogenesis) to light-grown development (photomorphogenesis) in part by rapid modulation of brassinosteroid sensitivity and levels.

To uncover this problem, the expression level of three ω-3 FAD genes (AtFAD3, AtFAD7, and AtFAD8) and the content of linolenic acid (C18:3) in both wild type (WT) and mutant (or WT suppressed) plants disrupted in the octadecanoid pathway were analyzed under normal conditions and the chilling treatment (4 °C), respectively. As compared with WT plants, chilling-induced organ-specific expressions of ω-3 FAD genes significantly changed when the octadecanoid pathway was blocked or suppressed, and presented either the ""suppressed increase"" or the ""enhanced decrease"" tendency.

27457979,Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinases 1 and 2 are involved in the regulation of vacuole morphology during Arabidopsis thaliana pollen development.,"The pollen grains arise after meiosis of pollen mother cells within the anthers. A series of complex structural changes follows, generating mature pollen grains capable of performing the double fertilization of the female megasporophyte. Several signaling molecules, including hormones and lipids, have been involved in the regulation and appropriate control of pollen development. Phosphatidylinositol 4-phophate 5-kinases (PIP5K), which catalyze the biosynthesis of the phosphoinositide PtdIns(4,5)P2, are important for tip polar growth of root hairs and pollen tubes, embryo development, vegetative plant growth, and responses to the environment. Here, we report a role of PIP5Ks during microgametogenesis. PIP5K1 and PIP5K2 are expressed during early stages of pollen development and their transcriptional activity respond to auxin in pollen grains. Early male gametophytic lethality to certain grade was observed in both pip5k1(-/-) and pip5k2(-/-) single mutants. The number of pip5k mutant alleles is directly related to the frequency of aborted pollen grains suggesting the two genes are involved in the same function. Indeed PIP5K1 and PIP5K2 are functionally redundant since homozygous double mutants did not render viable pollen grains. The loss of function of PIP5K1 and PIP5K2results in defects in vacuole morphology in pollen at the later stages and epidermal root cells. Our results show that PIP5K1, PIP5K2 and phosphoinositide signaling are important cues for early developmental stages and vacuole formation during microgametogenesis.",10.1016/j.plantsci.2016.05.014,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""phosphoinositide signaling"", ""lipid metabolism in pollen development""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Several signaling molecules, including hormones and lipids, have been involved in the regulation and appropriate control of pollen development."", ""Phosphatidylinositol 4-phophate 5-kinases (PIP5K), which catalyze the biosynthesis of the phosphoinositide PtdIns(4,5)P2, are important for tip polar growth of root hairs and pollen tubes, embryo development, vegetative plant growth, and responses to the environment.""], ""explanation"": ""The study focuses on PIP5K enzymes that synthesize phosphoinositides, key lipid signaling molecules regulating pollen development and vacuole morphology, thereby investigating lipid processes."", ""specific_topics"": [""phosphoinositide signaling"", ""lipid metabolism in pollen development""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",4: Lipid Signaling,success,4.0,Lipid Signaling

23445487,The Ca(2+) -binding protein PCaP2 located on the plasma membrane is involved in root hair development as a possible signal transducer.,"Plasma membrane-associated Ca(2+) -binding protein-2 (PCaP2) of Arabidopsis thaliana is a novel-type protein that binds to the Ca(2+) /calmodulin complex and phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PtdInsPs) as well as free Ca(2+) . Although the PCaP2 gene is predominantly expressed in root hair cells, it remains unknown how PCaP2 functions in root hair cells via binding to ligands. From biochemical analyses using purified PCaP2 and its variants, we found that the N-terminal basic domain with 23 amino acids (N23) is necessary and sufficient for binding to PtdInsPs and the Ca(2+) /calmodulin complex, and that the residual domain of PCaP2 binds to free Ca(2+) . In mutant analysis, a pcap2 knockdown line displayed longer root hairs than the wild-type. To examine the function of each domain in root hair cells, we over-expressed PCaP2 and its variants using the root hair cell-specific EXPANSIN A7 promoter. Transgenic lines over-expressing PCaP2, PCaP2(G2A) (second glycine substituted by alanine) and ∆23PCaP2 (lacking the N23 domain) exhibited abnormal branched and bulbous root hair cells, while over-expression of the N23 domain suppressed root hair emergence and elongation. The N23 domain was necessary and sufficient for the plasma membrane localization of GFP-tagged PCaP2. These results suggest that the N23 domain of PCaP2 negatively regulates root hair tip growth via processing Ca(2+) and PtdInsP signals on the plasma membrane, while the residual domain is involved in the polarization of cell expansion.",10.1111/tpj.12155,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""phosphatidylinositol phosphates"", ""lipid signaling"", ""Ca2+ binding proteins""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Plasma membrane-associated Ca(2+) -binding protein-2 (PCaP2) of Arabidopsis thaliana is a novel-type protein that binds to the Ca(2+) /calmodulin complex and phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PtdInsPs) as well as free Ca(2+)."", ""The N-terminal basic domain with 23 amino acids (N23) is necessary and sufficient for binding to PtdInsPs and the Ca(2+) /calmodulin complex.""], ""explanation"": ""PCaP2 directly interacts with phosphatidylinositol phosphates, a key class of membrane lipids, demonstrating that the study examines lipid-related processes such as lipid signaling and calcium-mediated regulation."", ""specific_topics"": [""phosphatidylinositol phosphates"", ""lipid signaling"", ""Ca2+ binding proteins""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",4: Lipid Signaling,success,4.0,Lipid Signaling
19885676,Adventitious rooting is enhanced by methyl jasmonate in tobacco thin cell layers.,"Adventitious roots (ARs) are induced by auxins. Jasmonic acid (JA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) are also plant growth regulators with many effects on development, but their role on ARs needs investigation. To this aim, we analyzed AR formation in tobacco thin cell layers (TCLs) cultured with 0.01-10 microM MeJA, either under root-inductive conditions, i.e., on medium containing 10 microM indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and 0.1 microM kinetin, or without hormones. The explants were excised from the cultivars Samsun, Xanthii and Petite Havana, and from genotypes with altered AR-forming ability in response to auxin, namely the non-rooting rac mutant and the over-rooting Agrobacterium rhizogenes rolB transgenic line. Results show that NtRNR1 (G1/S) and Ntcyc29 (G2/M) gene activity, cell proliferation and meristemoid formation were stimulated in hormone-cultured TCLs by submicromolar MeJA concentrations. The meristemoids developed either into ARs and xylogenic nodules, or into xylogenic nodules only (rac TCLs). MeJA-induced meristemoid over-production characterized rolB TCLs. No rooting or xylogenesis occurred under hormone-free conditions, independently of MeJA and genotype. Endogenous JA progressively (days 1-4) increased in hormone-cultured TCLs in the absence of MeJA. JA levels were enhanced by 0.1 microM MeJA, on both days 1 and 4. Endogenous IBA was the only auxin detected, both in the free form and as IBA-glucose. Free IBA increased up to day 2, remaining constant thereafter (day 4). Its level was enhanced by 0.1 microM MeJA only on day 1, while IBA conjugation was not affected by MeJA.

16501990,Nitric oxide enhances salt tolerance in maize seedlings through increasing activities of proton-pump and Na+/H+ antiport in the tonoplast.,"Nitric oxide (NO), an endogenous signaling molecule in animals and plants, mediates responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. Our previous work demonstrated that 100 microM sodium nitroprusside (SNP, an NO donor) treatment of maize seedlings increased K(+) accumulation in roots, leaves and sheathes, while decreasing Na(+) accumulation (Zhang et al. in J Plant Physiol Mol Biol 30:455-459, 2004b). Here we investigate how NO regulates Na(+), K(+) ion homeostasis in maize. Pre-treatment with 100 muM SNP for 2 days improved later growth of maize plants under 100 mM NaCl stress, as indicated by increased dry matter accumulation, increased chlorophyll content, and decreased membrane leakage from leaf cells. An NO scavenger, methylene blue (MB-1), blocked the effect of SNP. These results indicated that SNP-derived NO enhanced maize tolerance to salt stress. Further analysis showed that NaCl induced a transient increase in the NO level in maize leaves. Both NO and NaCl treatment stimulated vacuolar H(+)-ATPase and H(+)-PPase activities, resulting in increased H(+)-translocation and Na(+)/H(+) exchange. NaCl-induced H(+)-ATPase and H(+)-PPase activities were diminished by MB-1. 1-Butanol, an inhibitor of phosphatidic acid (PA) production by phospholipase D (PLD), reduced NaCl- and NO-induced H(+)-ATPase activation. In contrast, applied PA stimulated H(+)-ATPase activity. These results suggest that NO acts as a signal molecule in the NaCl response by increasing the activities of vacuolar H(+)-ATPase and H(+)-PPase, which provide the driving force for Na(+)/H(+) exchange. PLD and PA play an important role in this process.",10.1007/s00425-006-0242-z,True,high,True,high,"[""Zea mays""]","[""phosphatidic_acid"", ""phospholipase_D""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Zea mays""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""1-Butanol, an inhibitor of phosphatidic acid (PA) production by phospholipase D (PLD), reduced NaCl- and NO-induced H(+)-ATPase activation."", ""In contrast, applied PA stimulated H(+)-ATPase activity.""], ""explanation"": ""The study examines the role of phosphatidic acid (a lipid second messenger) produced via phospholipase D in modulating vacuolar H+-ATPase activity during nitric oxide-mediated salt tolerance in maize, indicating direct investigation of lipid signaling pathways."", ""specific_topics"": [""phosphatidic_acid"", ""phospholipase_D""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",4: Lipid Signaling,success,4.0,Lipid Signaling
24397856,N-Acylethanolamines: lipid metabolites with functions in plant growth and development.,"Twenty years ago, N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) were considered by many lipid chemists to be biological 'artifacts' of tissue damage, and were, at best, thought to be minor lipohilic constituents of various organisms. However, that changed dramatically in 1993, when anandamide, an NAE of arachidonic acid (N-arachidonylethanolamine), was shown to bind to the human cannabinoid receptor (CB1) and activate intracellular signal cascades in mammalian neurons. Now NAEs of various types have been identified in diverse multicellular organisms, in which they display profound biological effects. Although targets of NAEs are still being uncovered, and probably vary among eukaryotic species, there appears to be remarkable conservation of the machinery that metabolizes these bioactive fatty acid conjugates of ethanolamine. This review focuses on the metabolism and functions of NAEs in higher plants, with specific reference to the formation, hydrolysis and oxidation of these potent lipid mediators. The discussion centers mostly on early seedling growth and development, for which NAE metabolism has received the most attention, but also considers other areas of plant development in which NAE metabolism has been implicated.

27272019,Diacylglycerol kinases activate tobacco NADPH oxidase-dependent oxidative burst in response to cryptogein.,"Cryptogein is a 10 kDa protein secreted by the oomycete Phytophthora cryptogea that activates defence mechanisms in tobacco plants. Among early signalling events triggered by this microbial-associated molecular pattern is a transient apoplastic oxidative burst which is dependent on the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity of the RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG isoform D (RBOHD). Using radioactive [<sup>33</sup> P]-orthophosphate labelling of tobacco Bright Yellow-2 suspension cells, we here provide in vivo evidence for a rapid accumulation of phosphatidic acid (PA) in response to cryptogein because of the coordinated onset of phosphoinositide-dependent phospholipase C and diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) activities. Both enzyme specific inhibitors and silencing of the phylogenetic cluster III of the tobacco DGK family were found to reduce PA production upon elicitation and to strongly decrease the RBOHD-mediated oxidative burst. Therefore, it appears that PA originating from DGK controls NADPH-oxidase activity. Amongst cluster III DGKs, the expression of DGK5-like was up-regulated in response to cryptogein. Besides DGK5-like is likely to be the main cluster III DGK isoform silenced in one of our mutant lines, making it a strong candidate for the observed response to cryptogein. The relevance of these results is discussed with regard to early signalling lipid-mediated events in plant immunity.",10.1111/pce.12771,True,high,True,high,"[""tobacco""]","[""phosphatidic acid signaling"", ""diacylglycerol kinase activity"", ""lipid-mediated plant immunity""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""tobacco""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""we here provide in vivo evidence for a rapid accumulation of phosphatidic acid (PA) in response to cryptogein because of the coordinated onset of phosphoinositide-dependent phospholipase C and diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) activities."", ""Both enzyme specific inhibitors and silencing of the phylogenetic cluster III of the tobacco DGK family were found to reduce PA production upon elicitation and to strongly decrease the RBOHD\u2011mediated oxidative burst.""], ""explanation"": ""The study investigates the role of lipid signaling molecules\u2014specifically phosphatidic acid generated via diacylglycerol kinase\u2014in mediating the oxidative burst during plant immune responses, directly linking lipid metabolism to defense signaling."", ""specific_topics"": [""phosphatidic acid signaling"", ""diacylglycerol kinase activity"", ""lipid-mediated plant immunity""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",4: Lipid Signaling,success,4.0,Lipid Signaling
20674542,"Plasma membrane sterol complexation, generated by filipin, triggers signaling responses in tobacco cells.","The effects of changes in plasma membrane (PM) sterol lateral organization and availability on the control of signaling pathways have been reported in various animal systems, but rarely assessed in plant cells. In the present study, the pentaene macrolide antibiotic filipin III, commonly used in animal systems as a sterol sequestrating agent, was applied to tobacco cells. We show that filipin can be used at a non-lethal concentration that still allows an homogeneous labeling of the plasma membrane and the formation of filipin-sterol complexes at the ultrastructural level. This filipin concentration triggers a rapid and transient NADPH oxidase-dependent production of reactive oxygen species, together with an increase in both medium alkalinization and conductivity. Pharmacological inhibition studies suggest that these signaling events may be regulated by phosphorylations and free calcium. By conducting FRAP experiments using the di-4-ANEPPDHQ probe and spectrofluorimetry using the Laurdan probe, we provide evidence for a filipin-induced increase in PM viscosity that is also regulated by phosphorylations. We conclude that filipin triggers ligand-independent signaling responses in plant cells.

10806235,"Octadecanoid-derived alteration of gene expression and the ""oxylipin signature"" in stressed barley leaves. Implications for different signaling pathways.","Stress-induced gene expression in barley (Hordeum vulgare cv Salome) leaves has been correlated with temporally changing levels of octadecanoids and jasmonates, quantified by means of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry-single ion monitoring. Application of sorbitol-induced stress led to a low and transient rise of jasmonic acid (JA), its precursor 12-oxophytodienoic acid (OPDA), and the methyl esters JAME and OPDAME, respectively, followed by a large increase in their levels. JA and JAME peaked between 12 and 16 h, about 4 h before OPDA and OPDAME. However, OPDA accumulated up to a 2.5-fold higher level than the other compounds. Dihomo-JA and 9, 13-didehydro-OPDA were identified as minor components. Kinetic analyses revealed that a transient threshold of jasmonates or octadecanoids is necessary and sufficient to initiate JA-responsive gene expression.

40835858,Root-to-shoot mobile mRNA CmoKARI1 promotes JA-Ile biosynthesis to confer chilling tolerance in grafted cucumbers.,"Pumpkin rootstock is commonly used to graft cucurbit crops, improving their ability to withstand stress. While the significance of systemic signals from rootstocks to scions is recognized, the role of root-to-shoot transported mRNAs remains understudied. Cucumber plants often face growth and productivity limitations due to low temperatures. To shed light on the enhancement of chilling tolerance in grafted cucumber scions by pumpkin-derived mRNAs, we revisit the metabolomic and transcriptomic dataset from the cucumber/pumpkin heterograft under chilling condition. We identify pumpkin Ketol-acid reductoisomerase 1 (CmoKARI1) as the key mobile mRNA that specifically travels from pumpkin rootstock to cucumber scion upon early chilling stress. Overexpressing CmoKARI1 results in increased isoleucine level and chilling tolerance in both cucumber and Arabidopsis. The increased isoleucine is further used to synthesize JA-Ile conjugates, activating JA-Ile signaling and enabling heterografts to weather low temperatures.

Screening of a chemical library comprising 120 small molecules with known biological activities revealed four compounds reducing cellulysin- or flg22-activated gene expression of the early pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP)-responsive ATL2 gene. One chemical, oxytriazine, was found to induce ATL2 gene expression in the absence of PAMP. By monitoring additional flg22-triggered immediate early plant responses, we present evidence that two compounds, triclosan and fluazinam, interfere with the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and internalization of the activated plasma membrane resident FLS2 immune receptor. Using triclosan structure types and enzyme activity inhibition assays, Arabidopsis MOD1 enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, a subunit of the fatty-acid synthase type II (FAS II) complex, was identified as a likely cellular target of triclosan. Inhibition of all tested elicitor-triggered early immune responses by triclosan indicates a potential role for signaling lipids in flg22-triggered immunity.

17123826,Photon emissions from rice cells elicited by N-acetylchitooligosaccharide are generated through phospholipid signaling in close association with the production of reactive oxygen species.,"Biophotons are ultraweak light emissions from biochemical reactions in a living body. They increase in suspension-cultured rice (Oryza sativa L.) cells when elicited by N-acetylchitooligosaccharide. Biochemical analyses were undertaken to investigate the relationship between disease response and biophotons in order to clarify the emission mechanism of biophotons caused by this elicitor. Photon emissions induced by N-acetylchitohexaose were suppressed when cells were pretreated with the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating inhibitors: pyrocatechol-3,5-disulfonic acid disodium salt (Tiron); diphenylene iodonium (DPI); and salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM). Conversely, exogenously applied ROS (superoxide and hydrogen peroxide) were able to induce photon emissions. The effects of protein phosphorylation (K-252a) and the Ca(2+) signaling inhibitors, ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethylether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and LaCl(3), caused photon emissions to decrease. It is clear that photon emissions from rice cells elicited by N-acetylchitohexaose are closely associated with the ROS-generating system, and are regulated by Ca(2+) signaling and protein phosphorylation. Exogenously applied phosphatidic acid (PA), the second messenger in the signal transduction of disease response, raised photon emissions in rice cells. Comparisons of photon emissions from PA and N-acetylchitohexaose regarding time courses, spectral compositions, and the inhibition ratios of several inhibitors, as well as a loss- and gain-of-function assay using the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) and PA, showed the possibility that photon emissions from rice cells elicited by N-acetylchitooligosaccharide were generated through PA, an intermediate of phospholipid signaling.",10.1016/j.plaphy.2006.09.010,True,high,True,high,"[""Oryza sativa L.""]","[""phosphatidic acid signaling"", ""phospholipid-mediated ROS generation""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Oryza sativa L.""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Exogenously applied phosphatidic acid (PA), the second messenger in the signal transduction of disease response, raised photon emissions in rice cells."", ""showed the possibility that photon emissions from rice cells elicited by N-acetylchitooligosaccharide were generated through PA, an intermediate of phospholipid signaling.""], ""explanation"": ""The study explicitly investigates the role of phosphatidic acid, a key lipid signaling molecule, in mediating photon emissions via phospholipid signaling pathways, indicating a focus on lipid processes."", ""specific_topics"": [""phosphatidic acid signaling"", ""phospholipid-mediated ROS generation""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",4: Lipid Signaling,success,4.0,Lipid Signaling

The HsPIP5K-expressing (HK) cells had altered nuclear lipids and nuclear functions. HK cell nuclei had 2-fold increased PIP5K activity and increased steady state PtdIns(4,5)P(2).

26070643,Peroxisomes sense and respond to environmental cues by regulating ROS and RNS signalling networks.,"Peroxisomes are highly dynamic, metabolically active organelles that used to be regarded as a sink for H2O2 generated in different organelles. However, peroxisomes are now considered to have a more complex function, containing different metabolic pathways, and they are an important source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Over-accumulation of ROS and RNS can give rise oxidative and nitrosative stress, but when produced at low concentrations they can act as signalling molecules. This review focuses on the production of ROS and RNS in peroxisomes and their regulation by antioxidants. ROS production is associated with metabolic pathways such as photorespiration and fatty acid β-oxidation, and disturbances in any of these processes can be perceived by the cell as an alarm that triggers defence responses. Genetic and pharmacological studies have shown that photorespiratory H2O2 can affect nuclear gene expression, regulating the response to pathogen infection and light intensity. Proteomic studies have shown that peroxisomal proteins are targets for oxidative modification, S-nitrosylation and nitration and have highlighted the importance of these modifications in regulating peroxisomal metabolism and signalling networks. The morphology, size, number and speed of movement of peroxisomes can also change in response to oxidative stress, meaning that an ROS/redox receptor is required. Information available on the production and detection of NO/RNS in peroxisomes is more limited. Peroxisomal homeostasis is critical for maintaining the cellular redox balance and is regulated by ROS, peroxisomal proteases and autophagic processes. Peroxisomes play a key role in many aspects of plant development and acclimation to stress conditions. These organelles can sense ROS/redox changes in the cell and thus trigger rapid and specific responses to environmental cues involving changes in peroxisomal dynamics as well as ROS- and NO-dependent signalling networks, although the mechanisms involved have not yet been established. Peroxisomes can therefore be regarded as a highly important decision-making platform in the cell, where ROS and RNS play a determining role.",10.1093/aob/mcv074,True,high,True,high,,"[""fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": null, ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""ROS production is associated with metabolic pathways such as photorespiration and fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation, and disturbances in any of these processes can be perceived by the cell as an alarm that triggers defence responses.""], ""explanation"": ""The study explicitly links peroxisomal ROS production to fatty acid \u03b2\u2011oxidation, a key lipid catabolic pathway, indicating investigation into lipid-related processes."", ""specific_topics"": [""fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",4: Lipid Signaling,success,4.0,Lipid Signaling
27836964,Phospholipid composition and a polybasic motif determine D6 PROTEIN KINASE polar association with the plasma membrane and tropic responses.,"Polar transport of the phytohormone auxin through PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux carriers is essential for the spatiotemporal control of plant development. The Arabidopsis thaliana serine/threonine kinase D6 PROTEIN KINASE (D6PK) is polarly localized at the plasma membrane of many cells where it colocalizes with PINs and activates PIN-mediated auxin efflux. Here, we show that the association of D6PK with the basal plasma membrane and PINs is dependent on the phospholipid composition of the plasma membrane as well as on the phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5-kinases PIP5K1 and PIP5K2 in epidermis cells of the primary root. We further show that D6PK directly binds polyacidic phospholipids through a polybasic lysine-rich motif in the middle domain of the kinase. The lysine-rich motif is required for proper PIN3 phosphorylation and for auxin transport-dependent tropic growth. Polybasic motifs are also present at a conserved position in other D6PK-related kinases and required for membrane and phospholipid binding. Thus, phospholipid-dependent recruitment to membranes through polybasic motifs might not only be required for D6PK-mediated auxin transport but also other processes regulated by these, as yet, functionally uncharacterized kinases.",10.1242/dev.137117,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""phospholipid composition"", ""phosphatidylinositol phosphate"", ""membrane lipid interactions""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""The association of D6PK with the basal plasma membrane and PINs is dependent on the phospholipid composition of the plasma membrane as well as on the phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5\u2011kinases PIP5K1 and PIP5K2 in epidermis cells of the primary root."", ""D6PK directly binds polyacidic phospholipids through a polybasic lysine\u2011rich motif in the middle domain of the kinase.""], ""explanation"": ""The study investigates how phospholipid composition and specific phosphatidylinositol phosphates influence the membrane localization and functional interaction of D6PK with PIN proteins, thereby linking lipid signaling to auxin transport."", ""specific_topics"": [""phospholipid composition"", ""phosphatidylinositol phosphate"", ""membrane lipid interactions""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",4: Lipid Signaling,success,4.0,Lipid Signaling
9799511,Uncovering a calcium-regulated membrane-binding mechanism for soybean lipoxygenase-1.,"Lipoxygenases catalyze the biosynthesis of leukotrienes, lipoxins, and other lipid-derived mediators that are involved in a wide variety of pathophysiological processes, including inflammation, allergy, and tumorigenesis. Mammalian lipoxygenases are activated by a calcium-mediated translocation to intracellular membranes upon cell stimulation, and cooperate with cytosolic phospholipase A2 at the membrane surface to generate eicosanoids. Although it has been documented that plant cell stimulation increases intracellular Ca2+ concentration and activates cytosolic phospholipase A2, followed by lipoxygenase-catalyzed conversion of the liberated linolenic acid to jasmonic acid, no evidence is available for Ca2+-regulated membrane binding and activity of plant lipoxygenases. Plant lipoxygenases, unlike their mammalian counterparts, are believed to function independently of calcium or membranes. Here we present spectroscopic evidence for a calcium-regulated membrane-binding mechanism of soybean lipoxygenase-1 (L-1). Both calcium and membrane binding affect the structure and the mode of action of L-1. Free L-1 in solution is less accessible to the polar solvent and converts linoleic acid to conjugated dienes, whereas surface binding increases solvent accessibility and stimulates conjugated ketodiene production. Calcium exerts a biphasic effect on the structure and activity of L-1.

23252521,A proteomic approach identifies many novel palmitoylated proteins in Arabidopsis.,"S-acylation (palmitoylation) is a poorly understood post-translational modification of proteins involving the addition of acyl lipids to cysteine residues. S-acylation promotes the association of proteins with membranes and influences protein stability, microdomain partitioning, membrane targeting and activation state. No consensus motif for S-acylation exists and it therefore requires empirical identification. Here, we describe a biotin switch isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based method to identify S-acylated proteins from Arabidopsis. We use these data to predict and confirm S-acylation of proteins not in our dataset. We identified c. 600 putative S-acylated proteins affecting diverse cellular processes. These included proteins involved in pathogen perception and response, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) and RLK superfamily members, integral membrane transporters, ATPases, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-activating protein receptors (SNAREs) and heterotrimeric G-proteins. The prediction of S-acylation of related proteins was demonstrated by the identification and confirmation of S-acylation sites within the SNARE and LRR-RLK families. We showed that S-acylation of the LRR-RLK FLS2 is required for a full response to elicitation by the flagellin derived peptide flg22, but is not required for localization to the plasma membrane. Arabidopsis contains many more S-acylated proteins than previously thought. These data can be used to identify S-acylation sites in related proteins.

25778986,Identification of Early Nuclear Target Genes of Plastidial Redox Signals that Trigger the Long-Term Response of Arabidopsis to Light Quality Shifts.,"Natural illumination conditions are highly variable and because of their sessile life style, plants are forced to acclimate to them at the cellular and molecular level. Changes in light intensity or quality induce changes in the reduction/oxidation (redox) state of the photosynthetic electron chain that acts as a trigger for compensatory acclimation responses comprising functional and structural adjustments of photosynthesis and metabolism. Such responses include redox-controlled changes in plant gene expression in the nucleus and organelles. Here we describe a strategy for the identification of early redox-regulated genes (ERGs) in the nucleus of the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana that respond significantly 30 or 60 min after the generation of a reduction signal in the photosynthetic electron transport chain. By comparing the response of wild-type plants with that of the acclimation mutant stn7, we could specifically identify ERGs. The results reveal a significant impact of chloroplast redox signals on distinct nuclear gene groups including genes for the mitochondrial electron transport chain, tetrapyrrole biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, and signaling lipid synthesis. These expression profiles are clearly different from those observed in response to the reduction of photosynthetic electron transport by high light treatments. Thus, the ERGs identified are unique to redox imbalances in photosynthetic electron transport and were then used for analyzing potential redox-responsive cis-elements, trans-factors, and chromosomal regulatory hot spots.

Reversal of metaphase arrest results from treatments with calcium chloride (100 microM) after 5 to 8 min or with 1,2-DAG (i.e., 60 micrograms/ml 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol) after 7 to 11 min. In control experiments, metaphase arrest could not be reversed by treatment with either magnesium sulfate or 1,3-dioctanoylglycerol. Anaphase onset was observed in these control cells after post-treatment with calcium chloride (after 4-9 min) or with 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (after 7-13 min). The treatment of stamen hair cells in very early prophase with H-7, (i.e., 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride), a potent protein kinase C inhibitor, extends the duration of metaphase significantly. Neither H-8 nor HA-1004, less active protein kinase C inhibitors in this class of molecules, alter the duration of metaphase to a significant extent. These results suggest that in cells arrested in metaphyase by quin2, calcium translocation plays a role in the sequence of events which culminate in anaphase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,True,high,True,high,"[""Tradescantia virginiana""]","[""diacylglycerol signaling"", ""lipid-mediated calcium translocation"", ""protein kinase C activation""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Tradescantia virginiana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Reversal of metaphase arrest results from treatments with calcium chloride (100 microM) after 5 to 8 min or with 1,2-DAG (i.e., 60 micrograms/ml 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol) after 7 to 11 min."", ""In control experiments, metaphase arrest could not be reversed by treatment with either magnesium sulfate or 1,3-dioctanoylglycerol.""], ""explanation"": ""The study examines how diacylglycerol (DAG) species influence cell cycle progression in plant cells, directly implicating lipid signaling pathways such as PKC activation and calcium translocation."", ""specific_topics"": [""diacylglycerol signaling"", ""lipid-mediated calcium translocation"", ""protein kinase C activation""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",4: Lipid Signaling,success,4.0,Lipid Signaling
19473324,CVP2- and CVL1-mediated phosphoinositide signaling as a regulator of the ARF GAP SFC/VAN3 in establishment of foliar vein patterns.,"In foliar organs of dicots, veins are arranged in a highly branched or reticulated pattern for efficient distribution of water, photosynthates and signaling molecules. Recent evidence suggests that the patterns rely in part on regulation of intracellular vesicle transport and cell polarity in selected cells during leaf development. The sorting of vesicle cargos to discrete cellular sites is regulated in yeast and animal cells by the binding of specific phosphoinositides (PIs). We report here that, in the plant Arabidopsis, specific PIs guide the vesicle traffic that is essential for polarized and continuous vein pattern formation. Mutations in SFC/VAN3, an ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein (ARF GAP) with a PI-binding pleckstrin homology domain, result in discontinuous vein patterns. Plants with mutations in both CVP2 and CVL1, which encode inositol polyphosphate 5'-phosphatases that generate the specific PI ligand for the pleckstrin homology domain of SFC/VAN3, phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate (PI(4)P), have a discontinuous vein phenotype identical to that of sfc/van3 mutants. Single cvp2 or cvl1 mutants show weak and no discontinuous vein phenotypes, respectively, suggesting that they act redundantly. We propose that these two 5'-phosphatases regulate vein continuity and cell polarity by generating a specific PI ligand for SFC/VAN3.",10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03920.x,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""phosphoinositide signaling"", ""vesicle trafficking""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""The sorting of vesicle cargos to discrete cellular sites is regulated in yeast and animal cells by the binding of specific phosphoinositides (PIs)."", ""Mutations in SFC/VAN3, an ADP\u2011ribosylation factor GTPase\u2011activating protein (ARF GAP) with a PI\u2011binding pleckstrin homology domain, result in discontinuous vein patterns.""], ""explanation"": ""The study focuses on phosphoinositide (a class of membrane lipids) signaling pathways that regulate vesicle trafficking and cell polarity during leaf vein development, directly involving lipid molecules and their metabolic enzymes."", ""specific_topics"": [""phosphoinositide signaling"", ""vesicle trafficking""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",4: Lipid Signaling,success,4.0,Lipid Signaling
15567853,Keeping the leaves green above us.,"The plant immune system relies to a great extent on the highly regulated expression of hundreds of defense genes encoding antimicrobial proteins, such as defensins, and antiherbivore proteins, such as lectins. The expression of many of these genes is controlled by a family of mediators known as jasmonates; these cyclic oxygenated fatty acid derivatives are reminiscent of prostaglandins. The roles of jasmonates also extend to the control of reproductive development. How are these complex events regulated? Nearly 20 members of the jasmonate family have been characterized. Some, like jasmonic acid, exist in unmodified forms, whereas others are conjugated to other lipids or to hydrophobic amino acids. Why do so many chemically different forms of these mediators exist, and do individual jasmonates have unique signaling properties or are they made to facilitate transport within and between cells? Key features of the jasmonate signal pathway have been identified and include the specific activation of E3-type ubiquitin ligases thought to target as-yet-undescribed transcriptional repressors for modification or destruction. Several classes of transcription factor are known to function in the jasmonate pathway, and, in some cases, these proteins provide nodes that integrate this network with other important defensive and developmental pathways. Progress in jasmonate research is now rapid, but large gaps in our knowledge exist.

Here, we describe the isolation of a cDNA (3073 bp) coding for LOX-100, a protein of 936 amino acid residues and a molecular mass of 106 kDa. By sequence comparison this lipoxygenase could be identified as LOX2-type lipoxygenase and was therefore designated LOX2:Hv:1. The recombinant lipoxygenase was expressed in Escherichia coli and characterized as linoleate 13-LOX and arachidonate 15-LOX, respectively. The enzyme exhibited a pH optimum around pH 7.0 and a moderate substrate preference for linoleic acid. The gene was transiently expressed after exogenous application of jasmonic acid methyl ester with a maximum between 12 h and 18 h. Its expression was not affected by exogenous application of abscisic acid. Also a rise of endogenous jasmonic acid resulting from sorbitol stress did not induce LOX2:Hv:1, suggesting a separate signalling pathway compared with other jasmonate-induced proteins of barley.

26628746,Nitro-Fatty Acids in Plant Signaling: Nitro-Linolenic Acid Induces the Molecular Chaperone Network in Arabidopsis.,"Nitro-fatty acids (NO2-FAs) are the product of the reaction between reactive nitrogen species derived of nitric oxide (NO) and unsaturated fatty acids. In animal systems, NO2-FAs are considered novel signaling mediators of cell function based on a proven antiinflammatory response. Nevertheless, the interaction of NO with fatty acids in plant systems has scarcely been studied. Here, we examine the endogenous occurrence of nitro-linolenic acid (NO2-Ln) in Arabidopsis and the modulation of NO2-Ln levels throughout this plant's development by mass spectrometry. The observed levels of this NO2-FA at picomolar concentrations suggested its role as a signaling effector of cell function. In fact, a transcriptomic analysis by RNA-seq technology established a clear signaling role for this molecule, demonstrating that NO2-Ln was involved in plant defense response against different abiotic-stress conditions, mainly by inducing heat shock proteins and supporting a conserved mechanism of action in both animal and plant defense processes. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that NO2-Ln was also involved in the response to oxidative stress conditions, mainly depicted by H2O2, reactive oxygen species, and oxygen-containing compound responses, with a high induction of ascorbate peroxidase expression. Closely related to these results, NO2-Ln levels significantly rose under several abiotic-stress conditions such as wounding or exposure to salinity, cadmium, and low temperature, thus validating the outcomes found by RNA-seq technology. Jointly, to our knowledge, these are the first results showing the endogenous presence of NO2-Ln in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and supporting the strong signaling role of these molecules in the defense mechanism against different abiotic-stress situations.",10.1104/pp.15.01671,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""nitro\u2011fatty acids"", ""lipid signaling"", ""abiotic stress response""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Nitro-fatty acids (NO2-FAs) are the product of the reaction between reactive nitrogen species derived of nitric oxide (NO) and unsaturated fatty acids."", ""Here, we examine the endogenous occurrence of nitro-linolenic acid (NO2-Ln).""], ""explanation"": ""The study focuses on nitro\u2011fatty acids, a class of modified lipids, and their roles in plant signaling and stress responses, directly addressing fatty acid chemistry and lipid-mediated pathways."", ""specific_topics"": [""nitro\u2011fatty acids"", ""lipid signaling"", ""abiotic stress response""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",4: Lipid Signaling,success,4.0,Lipid Signaling
17215350,Arabidopsis systemic immunity uses conserved defense signaling pathways and is mediated by jasmonates.,"In the absence of adaptive immunity displayed by animals, plants respond locally to biotic challenge via inducible basal defense networks activated through recognition and response to conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns. In addition, immunity can be induced in tissues remote from infection sites by systemic acquired resistance (SAR), initiated after gene-for-gene recognition between plant resistance proteins and microbial effectors. The nature of the mobile signal and remotely activated networks responsible for establishing SAR remain unclear. Salicylic acid (SA) participates in the local and systemic response, but SAR does not require long-distance translocation of SA. Here, we show that, despite the absence of pathogen-associated molecular pattern contact, systemically responding leaves rapidly activate a SAR transcriptional signature with strong similarity to local basal defense. We present several lines of evidence that suggest jasmonates are central to systemic defense, possibly acting as the initiating signal for classic SAR. Jasmonic acid (JA), but not SA, rapidly accumulates in phloem exudates of leaves challenged with an avirulent strain of Pseudomonas syringae. In systemically responding leaves, transcripts associated with jasmonate biosynthesis are up-regulated within 4 h, and JA increases transiently. SAR can be mimicked by foliar JA application and is abrogated in mutants impaired in jasmonate synthesis or response. We conclude that jasmonate signaling appears to mediate long-distance information transmission. Moreover, the systemic transcriptional response shares extraordinary overlap with local herbivory and wounding responses, indicating that jasmonates may be pivotal to an evolutionarily conserved signaling network that decodes multiple abiotic and biotic stress signals.",10.1073/pnas.0605423104,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""jasmonate biosynthesis"", ""lipid\u2011derived signaling"", ""fatty acid oxidation""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Jasmonic acid (JA), but not SA, rapidly accumulates in phloem exudates of leaves challenged with an avirulent strain of Pseudomonas syringae."", ""In systemically responding leaves, transcripts associated with jasmonate biosynthesis are up\u2011regulated within 4\u202fh, and JA increases transiently.""], ""explanation"": ""The study examines jasmonic acid, a lipid\u2011derived oxylipin produced from fatty acids, focusing on its biosynthesis, accumulation, and role in systemic defense signaling, thereby addressing lipid metabolic processes."", ""specific_topics"": [""jasmonate biosynthesis"", ""lipid\u2011derived signaling"", ""fatty acid oxidation""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",4: Lipid Signaling,success,4.0,Lipid Signaling

17166839,Chemical interference of pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immune responses in Arabidopsis reveals a potential role for fatty-acid synthase type II complex-derived lipid signals.,"We describe an experimental setup using submerged cultures of Arabidopsis seedlings in 96-well microtiter plates that permits chemical intervention of rapid elicitor-mediated immune responses. Screening of a chemical library comprising 120 small molecules with known biological activities revealed four compounds reducing cellulysin- or flg22-activated gene expression of the early pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP)-responsive ATL2 gene. One chemical, oxytriazine, was found to induce ATL2 gene expression in the absence of PAMP. By monitoring additional flg22-triggered immediate early plant responses, we present evidence that two compounds, triclosan and fluazinam, interfere with the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and internalization of the activated plasma membrane resident FLS2 immune receptor. Using triclosan structure types and enzyme activity inhibition assays, Arabidopsis MOD1 enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, a subunit of the fatty-acid synthase type II (FAS II) complex, was identified as a likely cellular target of triclosan. Inhibition of all tested elicitor-triggered early immune responses by triclosan indicates a potential role for signaling lipids in flg22-triggered immunity.

29203558,SEIPIN Proteins Mediate Lipid Droplet Biogenesis to Promote Pollen Transmission and Reduce Seed Dormancy.,"Lipid droplets (LDs) are ubiquitous organelles in plant cells, but their physiological roles are largely unknown. To gain insight into the function of LDs in plants, we have characterized the Arabidopsis homologs of SEIPIN proteins, which are crucial factors for LD biogenesis in yeast and animals. <i>SEIPIN1</i> is expressed almost exclusively in embryos, while <i>SEIPIN2</i> and <i>SEIPIN3</i> have broader expression profiles with maximal levels in embryos and pollen, where LDs accumulate most abundantly. Genetic analysis demonstrates that all three <i>SEIPINs</i> contribute to proper LD biogenesis in embryos, whereas in pollen, only <i>SEIPIN2</i> and <i>SEIPIN3</i> play a significant role. The double <i>seipin2 seipin3</i> and triple <i>seipin</i> mutants accumulate extremely enlarged LDs in seeds and pollen, which hinders their subsequent mobilization during germination. Interestingly, electron microscopy analysis reveals the presence of nuclear LDs attached to type I nucleoplasmic reticulum in triple <i>seipin</i> mutant embryos, supporting that SEIPINs are essential for maintaining the correct polarity of LD budding at the nuclear envelope, restricting it to the outer membrane. In pollen, the perturbations in LD biogenesis and turnover are coupled to reduced germination in vitro and with lower fertilization efficiency in vivo. In seeds, germination per se is not affected in <i>seipin2 seipin3</i> and triple <i>seipin</i> mutants, but there is a striking increase in seed dormancy levels.

Using specific antibodies and proteomic techniques, we presently confirm the existence of this protein, which is a member of the short-chain steroid dehydrogenase reductase superfamily. We have measured its activity toward various steroids (cholesterol, dehydroepiandrosterone, cortisol, corticosterone, estradiol, estrone) and NAD(P)(H), either within purified OBs or as a purified bacterially expressed chimera. Both enzymatic systems (OBs purified from A. thaliana seeds as well as the chimeric enzyme) exhibited hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) activity toward estradiol (17beta-hydroxysteroid) with NAD+ or NADP+, NADP+ being the preferred cofactor. Low levels of activity were observed with cortisol or corticosterone (11beta-hydroxysteroids), but neither cholesterol nor DHEA (3beta-hydroxysteroids) were substrates, whatever the cofactor used. Similar activity profiles were found for both enzyme sources. Purified OBs were found to be also able to catalyze estrone reduction (17beta-ketosteroid reductase activity) with NADPH. The enzyme occurring in A. thaliana OBs can be classified as a NADP+-dependent 11beta-,17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/17beta-ketosteroid reductase.

Malic enzyme (ME), a ubiquitous metabolic enzyme in living organisms, catalyzes the decarboxylation of malate to produce pyruvate, CO<sub>2</sub>, and NAD(P)H, playing a role in multiple metabolic pathways including energy metabolism, photosynthesis, respiration, and biosynthesis. In this study, we identified the <i>Scenedesmus quadricauda</i> malic enzyme gene (<i>SqME</i>) and its biological functions, aiming to provide excellent target genes for the genetic improvement of higher plants. Based on the RNA-seq data from <i>S. quadricauda</i> under the biofilm cultivation mode with high CO<sub>2</sub> and light energy transfer efficiency and small water use, a highly expressed gene (<i>SqME</i>) functionally annotated as <i>ME</i> was cloned. The physicochemical properties of the <i>SqME</i>-encoded protein were systematically analyzed by bioinformatics tools. The subcellular localization of SqME was determined <i>via</i> transient transformation in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves. The biological functions of <i>SqME</i> were identified <i>via</i> genetic transformation in <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>, and the potential of SqME in the genetic improvement of higher plants was evaluated. The ORF of <i>SqME</i> was 1 770 bp, encoding 590 amino acid residues, and the encoded protein was located in chloroplasts. SqME was a NADP-ME, with the typical structural characteristics of ME. The ME activity in the transgenic <i>N. tabacum</i> plant was 1.8 folds of that in the wild-type control. Heterologous expression of <i>SqME</i> increased the content of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and total chlorophyll by 20.9%, 26.9%, and 25.2%, respectively, compared with the control. The transgenic tobacco leaves showed an increase of 54.0% in the fluorescence parameter NPQ and a decrease of 30.1% in Fo compared with the control.

23536049,Genetic control of soybean seed oil: II. QTL and genes that increase oil concentration without decreasing protein or with increased seed yield.,"Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] seed oil is the primary global source of edible oil and a major renewable and sustainable feedstock for biodiesel production. Therefore, increasing the relative oil concentration in soybean is desirable; however, that goal is complex due to the quantitative nature of the oil concentration trait and possible effects on major agronomic traits such as seed yield or protein concentration. The objectives of the present study were to study the relationship between seed oil concentration and important agronomic and seed quality traits, including seed yield, 100-seed weight, protein concentration, plant height, and days to maturity, and to identify oil quantitative trait loci (QTL) that are co-localized with the traits evaluated. A population of 203 F4:6 recombinant inbred lines, derived from a cross between moderately high oil soybean genotypes OAC Wallace and OAC Glencoe, was developed and grown across multiple environments in Ontario, Canada, in 2009 and 2010. Among the 11 QTL associated with seed oil concentration in the population, which were detected using either single-factor ANOVA or multiple QTL mapping methods, the number of QTL that were co-localized with other important traits QTL were six for protein concentration, four for seed yield, two for 100-seed weight, one for days to maturity, and one for plant height. The oil-beneficial allele of the QTL tagged by marker Sat_020 was positively associated with seed protein concentration. The oil favorable alleles of markers Satt001 and GmDGAT2B were positively correlated with seed yield. In addition, significant two-way epistatic interactions, where one of the interacting markers was solely associated with seed oil concentration, were identified for the selected traits in this study. The number of significant epistatic interactions was seven for yield, four for days to maturity, two for 100-seed weight, one for protein concentration, and one for plant height. The identified molecular markers associated with oil-related QTL in this study, which also have positive effects on other important traits such as seed yield and protein concentration, could be used in the soybean marker breeding programs aimed at developing either higher seed yield and oil concentration or higher seed protein and oil concentration per hectare. Alternatively, selecting complementary parents with greater breeding values due to positive epistatic interactions could lead to the development of higher oil soybean cultivars.",10.1007/s00122-013-2083-z,True,high,True,high,"[""Glycine max""]","[""seed oil concentration"", ""quantitative trait loci (QTL)"", ""lipid genetics"", ""epistatic interactions""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Glycine max""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Soybean seed oil is the primary global source of edible oil and a major renewable and sustainable feedstock for biodiesel production."", ""Increasing the relative oil concentration in soybean is desirable;"", ""Among the 11 QTL associated with seed oil concentration in the population..."", ""The oil-beneficial allele of the QTL tagged by marker Sat_020 was positively associated with seed protein concentration.""], ""explanation"": ""The study focuses on genetic factors influencing soybean seed oil concentration, identifying QTL linked to oil content and its interaction with other agronomic traits, thereby directly addressing lipid accumulation in plant seeds."", ""specific_topics"": [""seed oil concentration"", ""quantitative trait loci (QTL)"", ""lipid genetics"", ""epistatic interactions""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",5: Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets,success,5.0,Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets
19021883,Height-related growth declines in ponderosa pine are not due to carbon limitation.,"Decreased gas exchange as trees grow tall has been proposed to explain age-related growth declines in trees. We examined changes of mobile carbon stores (starch, sugars and lipids) with tree height in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) at two sites differing in water availability, and tested the following hypotheses: (1) carbon supply does not become increasingly limited as trees grow tall; rather, the concentration of mobile carbon compounds increases with tree height reflecting greater reductions of carbon sink activities relative to carbon assimilation; and (2) increases of stored mobile carbon compounds with tree height are greater in drier sites. Height-related growth reductions were associated with significant increases of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) and lipid concentrations in all tissues in the upper canopy and of NSC in the bole. Lipid concentrations in the bole decreased with tree height, but such decrease is not necessarily inconsistent with non-limiting carbon supply in tall trees. Furthermore, we found stronger increases of mobile carbon stores with tree height at the dry site relative to the moist site. Our results provide first direct evidence that carbon supply does not limit growth in tall trees and that decreases of water availability might negatively impact growth processes more than net-photosynthesis.",10.1111/j.1365-3040.2008.01896.x,True,high,True,high,"[""Pinus ponderosa""]","[""lipid concentration dynamics"", ""non-structural carbohydrate storage"", ""effects of tree height on lipid levels""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Pinus ponderosa""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Height-related growth reductions were associated with significant increases of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) and lipid concentrations in all tissues in the upper canopy and of NSC in the bole."", ""Lipid concentrations in the bole decreased with tree height, but such decrease is not necessarily inconsistent with non-limiting carbon supply in tall trees.""], ""explanation"": ""The study explicitly measures and reports changes in lipid concentrations across different tree tissues and heights, indicating an investigation into lipid dynamics within the context of tree growth."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid concentration dynamics"", ""non-structural carbohydrate storage"", ""effects of tree height on lipid levels""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",5: Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets,success,5.0,Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets
20067829,Use of oil bodies and oleosins in recombinant protein production and other biotechnological applications.,"Oil bodies obtained from oilseeds have been exploited for a variety of applications in biotechnology in the recent past. These applications are based on their non-coalescing nature, ease of extraction and presence of unique membrane proteins-oleosins. In suspension, oil bodies exist as separate entities and, hence, they can serve as emulsifying agent for a wide variety of products, ranging from vaccines, food, cosmetics and personal care products. Oil bodies have found significant uses in the production and purification of recombinant proteins with specific applications. The desired protein can be targeted to oil bodies in oilseeds by affinity tag or by fusing it directly to the N or C terminal of oleosins. Upon targeting, the hydrophobic domain of oleosin embeds into the TAG matrix of oil body, whereas the protein fused with N and/or C termini is exposed on the oil body surface, where it acquires correct confirmation spontaneously. Oil bodies with the attached foreign protein can be separated easily from other cellular components. They can be used directly or the protein can be cleaved from the fusion. The desired protein can be a pharmaceutically important polypeptide (e.g. hirudin, insulin and epidermal growth factor), a neutraceutical polypeptide (somatotropin), a commercially important enzyme (e.g. xylanase), a protein important for improvement of crops (e.g. chitinase) or a multimeric protein. These applications can further be widened as oil bodies can also be made artificially and oleosin gene can be expressed in bacterial systems. Thus, a protein fused to oleosin can be expressed in Escherichia coli and after cell lysis it can be incorporated into artificial oil bodies, thereby facilitating the extraction and purification of the desired protein. Artificial oil bodies can also be used for encapsulation of probiotics.

31245729,The effect of light conditions on interpreting oil composition engineering in Arabidopsis seeds.,"<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> is the most developed and utilized model plant. In particular, it is an excellent model for proof-of-concept seed oil engineering studies because it accumulates approximately 37% seed oil by weight, and it is closely related to important Brassicaceae oilseed crops. Arabidopsis can be grown under a wide variety of conditions including continuous light; however, the amount of light is strongly correlated with total seed oil accumulation. In addition, many attempts to engineer novel seed oil fatty acid compositions in Arabidopsis have reported significant reductions in oil accumulation; however, the relative reduction from the nontransgenic controls varies greatly within the literature. A set of experiments were conducted to systematically analyze the effect of light conditions (including day/night cycle vs. continuous light, and different light intensities) on the relative accumulation of seed oil between three different transgenic lines producing novel hydroxy fatty acids and their nontransgenic background. Oil content was measured per seed and as a percentage of seed weight. Our results indicate the relative amount of seed oil between transgenic lines and nontransgenic controls is dependent on both the light conditions and the type of oil content measurement utilized. In addition, the light conditions effect the relative accumulation of the novel fatty acids between various transgenic lines. Therefore, the success of novel fatty acid proof-of-concept engineering strategies on both oil accumulation and fatty acid composition in Arabidopsis seeds should be considered in light of the select growth and measurement conditions prior to moving engineering strategies into crop plants.",10.1002/pld3.67,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""fatty acid composition"", ""oil accumulation"", ""light conditions""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""In addition, many attempts to engineer novel seed oil fatty acid compositions in Arabidopsis have reported significant reductions in oil accumulation;"", ""Therefore, the success of novel fatty acid proof\u2011of\u2011concept engineering strategies on both oil accumulation and fatty acid composition in Arabidopsis seeds should be considered in light of the select growth and measurement conditions prior to moving engineering strategies into crop plants.""], ""explanation"": ""The study examines how light conditions affect seed oil content and the accumulation of novel fatty acids in Arabidopsis, directly addressing fatty acid composition and oil accumulation."", ""specific_topics"": [""fatty acid composition"", ""oil accumulation"", ""light conditions""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",5: Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets,success,5.0,Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets
40945374,Flue gas desulfurization gypsum as a sustainable amendment for coal mine soil reclamation and camelina-based bioenergy crop production.,"Flue gas desulfurization (FGD) gypsum, a byproduct of the chemical cleaning of FGD wastewater in coal-fired thermal electricity power plants, poses substantial environmental challenges, as it contains trace amounts of heavy metals and metalloids. In this study, we explored the potential use of FGD gypsum as a sustainable soil amendment to rehabilitate degraded coal mine soils and promote the cultivation of the bioenergy crop camelina (Camelina sativa). The sulfur content in FGD gypsum promoted glutathione and phytochelatin biosynthesis, enhancing heavy metal stress tolerance in camelina. Adding FGD gypsum to the soil improved camelina growth by reducing heavy metal toxicity, supporting photosynthesis, and increasing seed yield, while also extending the vegetative growth period from 85 days when grown in agricultural soil to 110-115 days. This treatment also enhanced the biosynthesis of the amino acids glutamic acid and proline, which are crucial for stress resilience. The application of lime rapidly increased soil pH from 4.6 to 6.9, helping initial seedlings establishment. However, lime amendment led to the bioaccumulation of mercury in seeds (0.34 mg/kg). In contrast, no detectable mercury was found in seeds from plants grown in soils amended with FGD gypsum, confirmed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Moreover, soils amended with FGD gypsum produced seeds enriched with desirable fatty acids, such as oleic acid, for bioenergy applications, offering a cost-effective alternative to lime. These results illustrate the environmental benefits of utilizing FGD gypsum as a soil amendment and for sustainable camelina-based bioenergy production on abandoned coal mine lands.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.127296,True,high,True,high,"[""Camelina sativa""]","[""fatty acid enrichment"", ""bioenergy applications""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Camelina sativa""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Moreover, soils amended with FGD gypsum produced seeds enriched with desirable fatty acids, such as oleic acid, for bioenergy applications.""], ""explanation"": ""The study reports that camelina seeds grown in FGD gypsum-amended soils contain higher levels of beneficial fatty acids, indicating an investigation into lipid composition."", ""specific_topics"": [""fatty acid enrichment"", ""bioenergy applications""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",5: Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets,success,5.0,Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets

The results of differential scanning calorimetry of wax obtained from seed hulls showed the melting temperature range of 13.18 degrees C with the onset at 62.32 degrees C, for purified wax, compared to the melting range of 24.73 degrees C with the onset at 42.3 degrees C. for crude wax. The enthalpy of fusion for both waxes were 57.55 mcal/mg and 7.63 mcal/mg, respectively.

16961733,A role for caleosin in degradation of oil-body storage lipid during seed germination.,"Caleosin is a Ca(2+)-binding oil-body surface protein. To assess its role in the degradation of oil-bodies, two independent insertion mutants lacking caleosin were studied. Both mutants demonstrated significant delay of breakdown of the 20:1 storage lipid at 48 and 60 h of germination. Additionally, although germination rates for seeds were not affected by the mutations, mutant seedlings grew more slowly than wild type when measured at 48 h of germination, a defect that was corrected with continued growth for 72 and 96 h in the light. After 48 h of germination, wild-type central vacuoles had smooth contours and demonstrated internalization of oil bodies and of membrane containing alpha- and delta-tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs), markers for protein storage vacuoles. In contrast, mutant central vacuoles had distorted limiting membranes displaying domains with clumps of the two TIPs, and they contained fewer oil bodies. Thus, during germination caleosin plays a role in the degradation of storage lipid in oil bodies. Its role involves both the normal modification of storage vacuole membrane and the interaction of oil bodies with vacuoles. The results indicate that interaction of oil bodies with vacuoles is one mechanism that contributes to the degradation of storage lipid.",10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02845.x,True,high,True,high,,"[""storage lipid degradation"", ""oil body metabolism""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": null, ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Both mutants demonstrated significant delay of breakdown of the 20:1 storage lipid at 48 and 60 h of germination."", ""Thus, during germination caleosin plays a role in the degradation of storage lipid in oil bodies.""], ""explanation"": ""The study examines how caleosin affects the breakdown of storage lipids (specifically 20:1 fatty acid) during seed germination, directly addressing lipid metabolism processes."", ""specific_topics"": [""storage lipid degradation"", ""oil body metabolism""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",5: Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets,success,5.0,Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets

B. campestris, for its simplicity of possessing only the AA genome and one predominant oleosin of 45 kDa, was studied. In the developing anthers, the lipids and proteins of the tapetosomes and elaioplasts were concomitantly accumulated but selectively degraded or retained. Upon incubation of isolated tapetosomes in a pH-5 medium, the predominant 45 kDa oleosin underwent selective enzymatic proteolysis to a 37 kDa fragment, which was not further hydrolyzed upon prolonged incubation. The unreacted 45 kDa oleosin was retained in the organelles, whereas the 37 kDa fragment was released to the exterior. The fragment would become the predominant 37 kDa polypeptide in the pollen coat. Isolated tapetosomes did not undergo hydrolysis of the TAGs upon incubation in media of diverse pHs. An alkaline lipase in the soluble fraction of the anther extract was presumed to be the enzyme that would hydrolyze the tapetosome TAGs, which disappeared in the anthers during development. The tapetum elaioplasts contained several unique polypeptides of 31-36 kDa. The gene encoding a 32 kDa polypeptide was cloned, and its deduced amino acid sequence was homologous to those of two proteins known to be present on the surface of fibrils in chromoplasts. Upon incubation of isolated elaioplasts in media of diverse pHs, the organelle polypeptides were degraded completely and most rapidly at pH 5, whereas the neutral esters remained unchanged; these neutral esters would become the major lipid components of the pollen coat.

29427340,Influence of the feed pipe position of an industrial scale two-phase decanter on extraction efficiency and chemical-sensory characteristics of virgin olive oil.,"Nowadays, olive oil extraction is basically achieved by means of two-phase decanters, which allow a reduction of water consumption and the leaching of phenolic compounds. Despite this, most of the working settings derive from studies carried out on three-phase decanters. Hence, the aim of the present study was to assess the influence of two-phase decanter feed pipe position (FP) on the extraction efficiency and chemical-sensory characteristics of virgin olive oil. Three different positions were considered: at 825 mm (FP1), 610 mm (FP2) and 520 mm (FP3) from the outlet of the oily phase. Position FP3 allowed the highest oil recovery (up to 10%), the lowest percentage of oil in the olive pomace and, in general, a regular trend in terms of oil extraction efficiency. However, the oily must that came out of the decanter was not completely clean in terms of residual content of solid sediment and water. The feeding position partially affected the profile of antioxidant compounds. In two-phase decanters, loading the olive paste close to the outlet of the oily phase is recommended to increase the extraction efficiency without jeopardizing the chemical-sensory characteristics of virgin olive oil. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.",10.1002/jsfa.8950,True,high,True,high,"[""Olea europaea""]","[""oil extraction efficiency"", ""lipid recovery"", ""phenolic compound leaching""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Olea europaea""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Nowadays, olive oil extraction is basically achieved by means of two-phase decanters, which allow a reduction of water consumption and the leaching of phenolic compounds."", ""Position FP3 allowed the highest oil recovery (up to 10%), the lowest percentage of oil in the olive pomace and, in general, a regular trend in terms of oil extraction efficiency.""], ""explanation"": ""The study focuses on extracting virgin olive oil, a lipid-rich product, assessing how decanter design affects oil yield and quality, thereby directly investigating lipid extraction processes."", ""specific_topics"": [""oil extraction efficiency"", ""lipid recovery"", ""phenolic compound leaching""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",5: Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets,success,5.0,Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets

Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy offers a robust nondestructive method of trait determination. However, traditional NIR bulk sampling techniques cannot be applied successfully to individual kernels. Obtaining optimized single kernel NIR spectra for applied chemometric predictive analysis requires a novel sampling technique that can account for the heterogeneous forms, morphologies, and opacities exhibited in individual maize kernels. In this study such a novel technique is described and compared to less effective means of single kernel NIR analysis.

All the experimental conditions were selected so as to assure the maximum coverage of the metabolome of the samples under study within a single run. The use of LC and GC with high resolution MS (through different ionization sources, ESI and APCI) and the annotation strategies within MetaboScape 3.0 software allowed the identification of around 150 compounds in the profiles, showing great complementarity between the evaluated methodologies. The identified metabolites belonged to different chemical classes: triterpenic acids and dialcohols, tocopherols, sterols, free fatty acids, and several sub-types of phenolic compounds. The suitability of each platform and polarity (negative and positive) to determine each family of metabolites was evaluated in-depth, finding, for instance, that LC-ESI-MS (+) was the most efficient choice to ionize phenolic acids, secoiridoids, flavonoids and lignans and LC-APCI-MS was very appropriate for pentacyclic triterpenic acids (MS (-)) and sterols and tocopherols (MS (+)). Afterwards, a semi-quantitative comparison of the selected matrices was carried out, establishing their typical features (e.g., fruit skin was pointed out as the matrix with the highest relative amounts of phenolic acids, triterpenic compounds and hydroxylated fatty acids, and seed oil was distinctive for its high relative levels of acetoxypinoresinol and tocopherols).",10.3390/molecules23102419,True,high,True,high,"[""Olea europaea""]","[""free fatty acids"", ""sterols"", ""tocopherols"", ""hydroxylated fatty acids""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Olea europaea""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""The identified metabolites belonged to different chemical classes: triterpenic acids and dialcohols, tocopherols, sterols, free fatty acids, and several sub-types of phenolic compounds."", ""Afterwards, a semi-quantitative comparison of the selected matrices was carried out, establishing their typical features (e.g., fruit skin was pointed out as the matrix with the highest relative amounts of phenolic acids, triterpenic compounds and hydroxylated fatty acids, and seed oil was distinctive for its high relative levels of acetoxypinoresinol and tocopherols).""], ""explanation"": ""The study identifies and quantifies various lipid-related compounds such as free fatty acids, sterols, tocopherols, and hydroxylated fatty acids across multiple olive-tree derived matrices using advanced LC/GC-MS techniques, indicating a clear focus on lipid chemistry."", ""specific_topics"": [""free fatty acids"", ""sterols"", ""tocopherols"", ""hydroxylated fatty acids""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",5: Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets,success,5.0,Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets
20190393,Oil-body-membrane proteins and their physiological functions in plants.,"Oilseeds accumulate a large amount of storage lipids, which are used as sources of carbon and energy for seed germination and seedling growth. The storage lipids are accumulated in oil bodies during seed maturation. Oil bodies in seeds are surrounded with three oil-body-membrane protein families, oleosins, caleosins and steroleosins. These proteins are plant-specific and much abundant in seeds. Here we show a unique function of oleosins in preventing fusion of oil bodies and maintaining seed germination. Reverse genetic analysis using oleosin-deficient mutants shows the inverse proportion of oil-body sizes to total oleosin contents. The double mutant ole1 ole2 with the lowest levels of oleosins has irregularly-enlarged oil bodies throughout the seed cells, and hardly germinates. Germination rates are positively associated with oleosin contents, suggesting that the defects of germination are related to the expansion of oil bodies due to oleosin deficiency. Interestingly, freezing treatment followed by imbibition at 4 degrees C inhibits seed germination of single mutants (ole1 and ole2), which germinate normally without freezing treatment. The freezing treatment accelerates the fusion of oil bodies and generates eccentric nuclei in ole1 seeds, which caused seed mortality. Taken together, our findings suggest that oleosins increase the viability of oilseeds by preventing abnormal fusion of oil bodies for overwintering. Knowledge of oleosin contributes a great deal to not only an insight into freezing tolerance of oilseeds, but also creating genetically modified plants for developing a bioenergy and biomass resource.",10.1248/bpb.33.360,True,high,True,high,,"[""storage lipids"", ""oil bodies"", ""oleosins""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": null, ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Oilseeds accumulate a large amount of storage lipids, which are used as sources of carbon and energy for seed germination and seedling growth."", ""The storage lipids are accumulated in oil bodies during seed maturation.""], ""explanation"": ""The study focuses on storage lipids within oil bodies of plant seeds, examining how oleosin proteins influence lipid droplet stability and seed germination, directly addressing lipid biology."", ""specific_topics"": [""storage lipids"", ""oil bodies"", ""oleosins""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",5: Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets,success,5.0,Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets

24535906,Effect of exogenous gibberellin on reserve accumulation during the seed filling stage of oilseed rape.,"Exogenous gibberellins (GAs) are widely applied to increase crop yields, with knowledge about the physiological functioning and biochemistry mechanisms of these phytohormones improving; however, information remains limited about the effect of GAs on seed filling. In this study, the siliques (containing the seeds) of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) were treated with GA3 at 3 stages of seed filling. We confirmed that GA3 regulates the deposition of storage reserves in developing seeds. The percentage of crude fat in the seeds increased during the early stage, but remained stable during the middle and late stages. In comparison, the percentage of total protein decreased during the early and middle stages, but significantly increased during the late stage. In addition, Q-PCR was employed to analyze the expression level of related genes in response to GA3. It was found that the expression of WRI and ABI3 transcription factors corresponded to crude fat content and total protein content, respectively. The expression of storage reserve related genes DGAT, MCAT, SUC2, and GPT was consistent with crude fat content, whereas the expression of Napin corresponded to total protein content. The results of this study indicate that exogenous GA3 has a different effect on storage reserve deposition in seed during different stages of seed filling, and the effect might be achieved via changing the expression of related genes.",10.4238/2014.January.22.7,True,high,True,high,"[""Brassica napus""]","[""fatty acid biosynthesis"", ""lipid metabolism""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Brassica napus""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""The percentage of crude fat in the seeds increased during the early stage, but remained stable during the middle and late stages."", ""The expression of storage reserve related genes DGAT, MCAT, SUC2, and GPT was consistent with crude fat content.""], ""explanation"": ""The study evaluates how exogenous gibberellin affects storage reserve deposition in oilseed rape seeds, specifically measuring changes in crude fat content and analyzing expression of key lipid\u2011biosynthetic genes such as DGAT, indicating direct investigation of fatty acid/lipid processes."", ""specific_topics"": [""fatty acid biosynthesis"", ""lipid metabolism""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",5: Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets,success,5.0,Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets
29894938,Soybean oleosomes studied by small angle neutron scattering (SANS).,"Oleosomes are stabilized by a complex outer phospholipid-protein-layer. To improve understanding of its structure and stabilization mechanism, this shell has to be studied in extracellular native conditions. This should be possible by SANS using contrast variation. Oleosomes are expected to be highly temperature stable, with molecular changes occurring first in the protein shell. Direct measurements of changes in the shell structure are also important for processing methods, e.g. encapsulation. Extracted soybean oleosomes were studied directly and after encapsulation with pectin by SANS using contrast variation. In order to determine structure and size, a shell model of oleosomes was developed. The method was tested against a simple phospholipid-stabilized emulsion. The oleosomes' temperature stability was investigated by performing SANS at elevated temperatures. Size (R<sub>g</sub> = 1380 Å) and shell thickness of native and encapsulated oleosomes have been determined. This is the first report measuring the shell thickness of oleosomes directly. For native oleosomes, a shell of 9 nm thickness surrounds the oil core, corresponding to a layer of phospholipids and proteins. Up to 90 °C, no structural change was observed, confirming the oleosomes' high temperature stability.

20078841,Vernonia DGATs increase accumulation of epoxy fatty acids in oil.,Vernolic acid (cis-12-epoxy-octadeca-cis-9-enoic acid) is valuable as a renewable chemical feedstock. This fatty acid can accumulate to high levels in the seed oil of some plant species such as Vernonia galamensis and Stokesia laevis which are unsuitable for large-scale production. A cost-effective alternative for production of epoxy fatty acids is to genetically engineer its biosynthesis in commercial oilseeds. An epoxygenase cDNA (SlEPX) responsible for vernolic acid synthesis and two acyl-CoA : diacylglycerol acyltransferase cDNAs (VgDGAT1 and VgDGAT2) catalysing triacylglycerol (TAG) formation were cloned from developing seeds of S. laevis and V. galamensis. Co-expression of SlEPX and VgDGAT1 or VgDGAT2 greatly increases accumulation of vernolic acid both in petunia leaves and soybean somatic embryos. Seed-specific expression of VgDGAT1 and VgDGAT2 in SlEPX mature soybean seeds results in vernolic acid levels of approximately 15% and 26%.

The use of ethanol and isopropanol has important advantages, including low toxicity and good operational safety. Thus, in the present study, solid-liquid extractions were performed in a single stage from 60 to 90 °C and in consecutive extractions in three stages at 90 °C. Solvent hydration negatively affected the extraction of oil but favored the extraction of chlorogenic acids (CAs), especially when ethanol was used. Regarding oxidative stability, the oils extracted using ethanol presented long induction times, which could be related to the high levels of not only CAs and tocopherols, but also phospholipids. Alcoholic solvents can be used for extraction to produce sunflower seed oil containing minor compounds that give it greater oxidative stability.

40260786,Comparative Assessment of Extraction Efficiency and Physical Stability of Rapeseed Oleosome-Protein Mixtures via Centrifugation Versus Cheesecloth Filtration.,"Oleosomes, naturally occurring plant-based oil droplets, have gained prominence as versatile emulsifying agents when combined with proteins in food applications. However, the extraction efficiency and physical stability of oleosome and protein mixture extracted from rapeseeds can be affected by the extraction method. Thus, this study compares the centrifugation and cheesecloth filtration methods on the composition, yield, the physico-chemical properties, and the storage stability of oleosome-protein mixtures. Results showed a higher oleosome and protein extraction yield (77 and 57 w/w%) by filtration method compared to centrifugation (70 and 50 w/w%). The oleosome and protein concentrations in the mixtures, as well as viscosity, remained comparable between the two methods. Filtration could enhance the stability of oleosome-protein mixtures compared to centrifugation, irrespective of pH variations and heating treatment at 90°C for 15 min. This stability improvement was attributed to differences in energy density resulting from mechanical forces rather than viscosity and composition.

22611176,Loss of XRN4 function can trigger cosuppression in a sequence-dependent manner.,"OLE1 encodes an oleosin isoprotein, a major membrane protein of the lipid-reserve organelle in seeds known as the oil body. Transgenic Arabidopsis were generated to contain an artificial chimeric transgene composed of OLE1 and green fluorescent protein (GFP). Overexpression of the fusion protein allowed visualization of the oil body size and structure in living cells using fluorescence microscopy. Two mutants, xrn4-8(OleG) and xrn4-9(OleG), accumulating enlarged oil bodies with reduced GFP fluorescence were isolated from the mutagenized progeny of a transgenic plant. Both mutants contained a defect in EXORIBONUCLEASE4 (XRN4), a gene known to encode a ribonuclease that specifically degrades uncapped mRNAs. Transgene expression was silenced in these mutants, as demonstrated by the reduced levels of the transgene mRNA and its product, OLE1-GFP. XRN4 loss of function also triggered cosuppression, i.e. simultaneous reduction in expression of the transgene and an endogenous OLE1 gene that shared a region of identical sequence. The enlarged oil bodies exhibiting reduced GFP fluorescence were formed in the xrn4-8(OleG) and xrn4-9(OleG) mutants due to the reduction of the endogenous OLE1 and the transgene product, OLE1-GFP, respectively. Cosuppression triggered by the xrn4 mutation also occurs for other genes such as PYK10, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) body-resident β-glucosidase. The overall results indicate that a loss of XRN4 function can potentially trigger the cosuppression in a sequence-dependent manner.",10.1093/pcp/pcs078,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""oleosin"", ""oil body"", ""lipid reserve organelle""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""OLE1 encodes an oleosin isoprotein, a major membrane protein of the lipid\u2011reserve organelle in seeds known as the oil body."", ""The enlarged oil bodies exhibiting reduced GFP fluorescence were formed in the xrn4-8(OleG) and xrn4-9(OleG) mutants due to the reduction of the endogenous OLE1 and the transgene product, OLE1-GFP, respectively.""], ""explanation"": ""The manuscript focuses on how loss of XRN4 affects expression of the oleosin gene OLE1 and consequently alters oil body morphology, directly implicating lipid storage organelles and their associated proteins."", ""specific_topics"": [""oleosin"", ""oil body"", ""lipid reserve organelle""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",5: Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets,success,5.0,Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets
40155815,Unveiling transfer RNA modifications of oil palm and their dynamic changes during fruit ripening.,"The oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) is a crucial agricultural commodity, yielding the highest oil output among oil-bearing crops. Despite its significance, productivity challenges persist due to genetic and environmental factors. This study breaks new ground by mapping tRNA modifications in oil palm, exploring their roles during fruit ripening, an area not extensively studied in non-model crops. Utilizing advanced RNA mass spectrometry techniques, we identified 48 distinct tRNA modifications across 88 sites, alongside 164 genes associated with tRNA modifying enzymes. This comprehensive mapping reveals the decreasing nature of most tRNA modifications during fruit development, except for adenosine 2'-O methylation (Am). It hints at a gradual weakening of protein translation quality control and highlights a unique role for Am during fruit ripening. Additionally, lipidomic analysis tracked 674 lipids in oil palm fruits, indicating a correlation between tRNA modifications and the accumulation of specific lipids.

After a short introduction to the biosynthesis of storage lipids, i.e. triacylglycerols and wax esters, this review covers the occurrence and biosynthesis of storage lipids in plant cell and embryo cultures. Plant cells in culture generally contain low levels of both unusual fatty acids and triacylglycerols indicating that these cells are quite different from cells of oil storage tissues. There are a few exceptions to this rule which demonstrate that induction of genes involved in the expression of fatty acid modification and triacylglycerol assembly is possible in plant cell cultures. Such biosynthetically active plant cells may be of particular interest in future studies of storage lipid assembly. Both somatic and gametophytic embryos of oil plants exhibit high capacities for storage lipid biosynthesis and accumulation in vitro compared to cultured plant cells.

40590970,Enhanced seed oil content by overexpressing LPAAT and WRI1 genes in tobacco plant.,"WRI1 and LPAAT gene overexpression enhances oil content and seed weight in tobacco plants, indicating potential candidate genes for enhancing seed oil in transgenic oil seed crops. The boosting triacylglycerols (TAG) assembly reactions (pull), the increasing fatty acid (FA) production (push), and the combination of these strategies were used to enhance seed oil content in transgenic tobacco plants. Three lines containing WRINKLED1 (WRI) (A1, A2, A7), two lines containing Lysophosphatidic Acid Acyltransferase (LPAAT) (B2, B3), and two lines containing WRI + LPAAT (AB1, AB2) transgenes were grown in greenhouse conditions and their T3 generations were used for further analysis. Total seed oil content in transgenic plants significantly increased within the range of 23.92-41%, respectively, in B3 and A7 lines than the non-transgenic tobacco plants. In addition, significantly elevated soluble sugar contents within 103.33-136.05 mg/g DW and 88.85-114.3 mg/g DW were observed, respectively, in the leaves and seeds of transgenic lines compared to control plants. We suggested that the enhanced accumulations of total soluble sugar in the seeds and leaves contribute to reallocation of the photosynthetic precursors for enhanced oil synthesis in transgenic plants. Expression analysis of WRI1 and LPAAT genes in transgenic plants showed a weak positive correlation with oil content (r ≈ 0.42). Overexpression of WRI1 and LPAAT increased seed size and weight, potentially explaining oil accumulation due to increased seed weight. Finally, no synergistic effect was observed in the simultaneous expression of WRI1 and LPAAT genes, suggesting potential limitations in the availability of oil biosynthesis precursors and interactions with other genes. Meanwhile, these findings show that WRI1 and LPAAT are reliable targets for genetic transformation of oil seed crops for improvement their seed oil yield.",10.1007/s00299-025-03554-2,True,high,True,high,"[""Nicotiana tabacum""]","[""triacylglycerol synthesis"", ""fatty acid biosynthesis"", ""oil accumulation""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Nicotiana tabacum""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""The boosting triacylglycerols (TAG) assembly reactions (pull), the increasing fatty acid (FA) production (push), and the combination of these strategies were used to enhance seed oil content in transgenic tobacco plants."", ""Total seed oil content in transgenic plants significantly increased within the range of 23.92-41%, respectively, in B3 and A7 lines than the non\u2011transgenic tobacco plants.""], ""explanation"": ""The study directly manipulates genes involved in fatty acid and triacylglycerol biosynthesis and measures changes in seed oil content, demonstrating investigation into lipid metabolism processes."", ""specific_topics"": [""triacylglycerol synthesis"", ""fatty acid biosynthesis"", ""oil accumulation""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",5: Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets,success,5.0,Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets
20492107,Ultrasonic investigation of the effect of vegetable shortening and mixing time on the mechanical properties of bread dough.,"Mixing is a critical stage in breadmaking since it controls gluten development and nucleation of gas bubbles in the dough. Bubbles affect the rheology of the dough and largely govern the quality of the final product. This study used ultrasound (at a frequency where it is sensitive to the presence of bubbles) to nondestructively examine dough properties as a function of mixing time in doughs prepared from strong red spring wheat flour with various amounts of shortening (0%, 2%, 4%, 8% flour weight basis). The doughs were mixed for various times at atmospheric pressure or under vacuum (to minimize bubble nucleation). Ultrasonic velocity and attenuation (nominally at 50 kHz) were measured in the dough, and dough density was measured independently from specific gravity determinations. Ultrasonic velocity decreased substantially as mixing time increased (and more bubbles were entrained) for all doughs mixed in air; for example, in doughs made without shortening, velocity decreased from 165 to 105 ms(-1), although superimposed on this overall decrease was a peak in velocity at optimum mixing time. Changes in attenuation coefficient due to the addition of shortening were evident in both air-mixed and vacuum-mixed doughs, suggesting that ultrasound was sensitive to changes in the properties of the dough matrix during dough development and to plasticization of the gluten polymers by the shortening. Due to its ability to probe the effect of mixing times and ingredients on dough properties, ultrasound has the potential to be deployed as an online quality control tool in the baking industry.",10.1111/j.1750-3841.2009.01346.x,True,high,True,high,"[""Triticum aestivum""]","[""shortening effects"", ""gluten plasticization"", ""dough rheology""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Triticum aestivum""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""with various amounts of shortening (0%, 2%, 4%, 8% flour weight basis)"", ""Changes in attenuation coefficient due to the addition of shortening were evident in both air\u2011mixed and vacuum\u2011mixed doughs, suggesting that ultrasound was sensitive to changes in the properties of the dough matrix during dough development and to plasticization of the gluten polymers by the shortening.""], ""explanation"": ""The study examines how adding vegetable shortening\u2014a source of lipids\u2014affects dough properties such as ultrasonic velocity, attenuation, and density, indicating a focus on lipid influence."", ""specific_topics"": [""shortening effects"", ""gluten plasticization"", ""dough rheology""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",5: Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets,success,5.0,Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets

Despite their importance, there is a lack of an essential bioinformatics resource on gene transcription of oil crops from a comparative perspective. In this study, we developed ocsESTdb, the first database of expressed sequence tag (EST) information on seeds of four large-scale oil crops with an emphasis on global metabolic networks and oil accumulation metabolism that target the involved unigenes. A total of 248,522 ESTs and 106,835 unigenes were collected from the cDNA libraries of rapeseed (Brassica napus), soybean (Glycine max), sesame (Sesamum indicum) and peanut (Arachis hypogaea). These unigenes were annotated by a sequence similarity search against databases including TAIR, NR protein database, Gene Ontology, COG, Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Five genome-scale metabolic networks that contain different numbers of metabolites and gene-enzyme reaction-association entries were analysed and constructed using Cytoscape and yEd programs. Details of unigene entries, deduced amino acid sequences and putative annotation are available from our database to browse, search and download. Intuitive and graphical representations of EST/unigene sequences, functional annotations, metabolic pathways and metabolic networks are also available. ocsESTdb will be updated regularly and can be freely accessed at http://ocri-genomics.org/ocsESTdb/ . ocsESTdb may serve as a valuable and unique resource for comparative analysis of acyl lipid synthesis and metabolism in oilseed plants.

11402213,Seed-specific over-expression of an Arabidopsis cDNA encoding a diacylglycerol acyltransferase enhances seed oil content and seed weight.,"We recently reported the cloning and characterization of an Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia) diacylglycerol acyltransferase cDNA (Zou et al., 1999) and found that in Arabidopsis mutant line AS11, an ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutation at a locus on chromosome II designated as Tag1 consists of a 147-bp insertion in the DNA, which results in a repeat of the 81-bp exon 2 in the Tag1 cDNA. This insertion mutation is correlated with an altered seed fatty acid composition, reduced diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT; EC 2.3.1.20) activity, reduced seed triacylglycerol content, and delayed seed development in the AS11 mutant. The effect of the insertion mutation on microsomal acyl-coenzyme A-dependent DGAT is examined with respect to DGAT activity and its substrate specificity in the AS11 mutant relative to wild type. We demonstrate that transformation of mutant AS11 with a single copy of the wild-type Tag1 DGAT cDNA can complement the fatty acid and reduced oil phenotype of mutant AS11. More importantly, we show for the first time that seed-specific over-expression of the DGAT cDNA in wild-type Arabidopsis enhances oil deposition and average seed weight, which are correlated with DGAT transcript levels. The DGAT activity in developing seed of transgenic lines was enhanced by 10% to 70%.

27314514,Cumulative effect of heterologous AtWRI1 gene expression and endogenous BjAGPase gene silencing increases seed lipid content in Indian mustard Brassica juncea.,"The production of vegetable oil in many countries of the world, including India has not been able to keep pace with the increasing requirement, leading to a very large gap in the demand-supply chain. Thus, there is an urgent need to increase the yield potential of the oilseed crops so as to enhance the storage lipid productivity. The present study describes a novel metabolic engineering ploy involving the constitutive down-regulation of endogenous ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (BjAGPase) enzyme and the seed-specific expression of WRINKLED1 transcription factor (AtWRI1) from Arabidopsis thaliana in Indian mustard (Brassica juncea) with an aim to divert the photosynthetically fixed carbon pool from starch to lipid synthesis in the seeds for the enhanced production of storage lipids in the seeds of transgenic mustard plants. The starch content, in both the vegetative leaf and developing seed tissues of the transgenic B. juncea lines exhibited a reduction by about 45-53% compared to the untransformed control, whereas the soluble sugar content was increased by 2.4 and 1.3-fold in the leaf and developing seed tissues, respectively. Consequently, the transgenic lines showed a significant enhancement in total seed lipid content ranging between 7.5 and 16.9%. The results indicate that the adopted metabolic engineering strategy was successful in significantly increasing the seed oil content. Therefore, findings of our research suggest that the metabolic engineering strategy adopted in this study for shifting the anabolic carbon flux from starch synthesis to lipid biosynthesis can be employed for increasing the storage lipid content of seeds in other plant species.",10.1016/j.plaphy.2016.06.004,True,high,True,high,"[""Brassica juncea""]","[""lipid biosynthesis"", ""seed oil content"", ""metabolic engineering""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Brassica juncea""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""The present study describes a novel metabolic engineering ploy involving the constitutive down\u2011regulation of endogenous ADP\u2011glucose pyrophosphorylase (BjAGPase) enzyme and the seed\u2011specific expression of WRINKLED1 transcription factor (AtWRI1) from Arabidopsis thaliana in Indian mustard (Brassica juncea) with an aim to divert the photosynthetically fixed carbon pool from starch to lipid synthesis in the seeds for the enhanced production of storage lipids in the seeds of transgenic mustard plants."", ""Consequently, the transgenic lines showed a significant enhancement in total seed lipid content ranging between 7.5 and 16.9%.""], ""explanation"": ""The study manipulates genes involved in lipid biosynthesis to increase seed oil content, directly measuring changes in lipid levels."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid biosynthesis"", ""seed oil content"", ""metabolic engineering""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",5: Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets,success,5.0,Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets
18837506,Effect of the corn breaking method on oil distribution between stillage phases of dry-grind corn ethanol production.,"The majority of fuel ethanol in the United States is produced by using the dry-grind corn ethanol process. The corn oil that is contained in the coproduct, distillers' dried grains with solubles (DDGS), can be recovered for use as a biodiesel feedstock. Oil removal will also improve the feed quality of DDGS. The most economical way to remove oil is considered to be at the centrifugation step for separating thin stillage (liquid) from coarse solids after distilling the ethanol. The more oil there is in the liquid, the more it can be recovered by centrifugation. Therefore, we studied the effects of corn preparation and grinding methods on oil distribution between liquid and solid phases. Grinding the corn to three different particle sizes, flaking, flaking and grinding, and flaking and extruding were used to break up the corn kernel before fermentation, and their effects on oil distribution between the liquid and solid phases were examined by simulating an industrial decanter centrifuge. Total oil contents were measured in the liquid and solids after centrifugation. Dry matter yield and oil partitioning in the thin stillage were highly positively correlated. Flaking slightly reduced bound fat. The flaked and then extruded corn meal released the highest amount of free oil, about 25% compared to 7% for the average of the other treatments. The freed oil from flaking, however, became nonextractable after the flaked corn was ground. Fine grinding alone had little effect on oil partitioning.",10.1021/jf801970n,True,high,True,high,"[""Zea mays""]","[""oil partitioning"", ""free oil release"", ""bound fat reduction""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Zea mays""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""The corn oil that is contained in the coproduct, distillers' dried grains with solubles (DDGS), can be recovered for use as a biodiesel feedstock."", ""Total oil contents were measured in the liquid and solids after centrifugation.""], ""explanation"": ""The study examines how different corn processing methods affect the distribution and recovery of oil (fat) between liquid and solid fractions during ethanol production, directly addressing lipid content and extraction processes."", ""specific_topics"": [""oil partitioning"", ""free oil release"", ""bound fat reduction""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",5: Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets,success,5.0,Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets

A total of 278 sorghum samples were scanned as whole and ground grain to develop calibration equations. Laboratory analyses were performed on NIRS sample subsets that preserved the core collection racial distribution. Principal component analysis performed on NIRS spectra evidenced a level of structure following known sorghum races, which underlined the importance of using a wide range of genetic diversity. Performances of calibration equations were evaluated by the coefficient of determination, bias, standard error of laboratory (SEL), and ratio of performance deviation (RPD). Ground grain spectra gave better calibration equations than whole grain. PR equation (RPD of 5.7) can be used for quality control. ET, LI, and HD equations (RPD of 2.9, 2.6, and 2.6, respectively) can be used for screening steps.

21921115,Targeted enhancement of glutamate-to-γ-aminobutyrate conversion in Arabidopsis seeds affects carbon-nitrogen balance and storage reserves in a development-dependent manner.,"In seeds, glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) operates at the metabolic nexus between carbon and nitrogen metabolism by catalyzing the unidirectional decarboxylation of glutamate to form γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). To elucidate the regulatory role of GAD in seed development, we generated Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) transgenic plants expressing a truncated GAD from Petunia hybrida missing the carboxyl-terminal regulatory Ca(2+)-calmodulin-binding domain under the transcriptional regulation of the seed maturation-specific phaseolin promoter. Dry seeds of the transgenic plants accumulated considerable amounts of GABA, and during desiccation the content of several amino acids increased, although not glutamate or proline. Dry transgenic seeds had higher protein content than wild-type seeds but lower amounts of the intermediates of glycolysis, glycerol and malate. The total fatty acid content of the transgenic seeds was 50% lower than in the wild type, while acyl-coenzyme A accumulated in the transgenic seeds. Labeling experiments revealed altered levels of respiration in the transgenic seeds, and fractionation studies indicated reduced incorporation of label in the sugar and lipid fractions extracted from transgenic seeds. Comparative transcript profiling of the dry seeds supported the metabolic data. Cellular processes up-regulated at the transcript level included the tricarboxylic acid cycle, fatty acid elongation, the shikimate pathway, tryptophan metabolism, nitrogen-carbon remobilization, and programmed cell death. Genes involved in the regulation of germination were similarly up-regulated. Taken together, these results indicate that the GAD-mediated conversion of glutamate to GABA during seed development plays an important role in balancing carbon and nitrogen metabolism and in storage reserve accumulation.",10.1104/pp.111.179986,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""fatty acid composition"", ""lipid metabolism"", ""seed lipid biosynthesis""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""The total fatty acid content of the transgenic seeds was 50% lower than in the wild type, while acyl\u2011coenzyme A accumulated in the transgenic seeds."", ""Labeling experiments revealed altered levels of respiration in the transgenic seeds, and fractionation studies indicated reduced incorporation of label in the sugar and lipid fractions extracted from transgenic seeds.""], ""explanation"": ""The study reports significant reductions in total fatty acid content and altered lipid fraction labeling in transgenic Arabidopsis seeds, indicating direct investigation of lipid metabolism."", ""specific_topics"": [""fatty acid composition"", ""lipid metabolism"", ""seed lipid biosynthesis""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",5: Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets,success,5.0,Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets

Biochemical changes in the mesocarp cell walls, polyamines, and hormones at different ripening stages of oil palm fruits were studied, and the relationship between the structural and the biochemical metabolism of oil palm fruits during ripening is discussed. Time-course analysis of the changes in expression of polyamines, hormones, and cell-wall-related genes and metabolites provided insights into the complex processes and interactions involved in fruit development. Overall, a strong reduction in auxin-responsive gene expression was observed from 18 to 22 weeks after pollination. High polyamine concentrations coincided with fruit enlargement during lipid accumulation and latter stages of maturation. The trend of abscisic acid (ABA) concentration was concordant with GA₄ but opposite to the GA₃ profile such that as ABA levels increase the resulting elevated ABA/GA₃ ratio clearly coincides with maturation.

18761499,The mechanisms of refilling of xylem conduits and bleeding of tall birch during spring.,"Seasonal variations in osmolality and components of xylem sap in tall birch trees were determined using several techniques. Xylem sap was extracted from branch and trunk sections of 58 trees using the very rapid gas bubble-based jet-discharge method. The 5-cm long wood pieces were taken at short intervals over the entire tree height. The data show that large biphasic osmolality gradients temporarily exist within the conducting xylem conduits during leaf emergence (up to 272 mosmol x kg(-1) at the apex). These gradients (arising mainly from glucose and fructose) were clearly held within the xylem conduit as demonstrated by (1)H NMR imaging of intact twigs. Refilling experiments with benzene, sucrose infusion, electron and light microscopy, as well as (1)H NMR chemical shift microimaging provided evidence that the xylem of birch represents a compartment confined by solute-reflecting barriers (radial: lipid linings/lipid bodies; axial: presumably air-filled spaces). These features allow transformation of osmolality gradients into osmotic pressure gradients. Refilling of the xylem occurs by a dual mechanism: from the base (by root pressure) and from the top (by hydrostatic pressure generated by xylem-bound osmotic pressure). The generation of osmotic pressure gradients was accompanied by bleeding. Bleeding could be observed at a height of up to 21 m. Bleeding rates measured at a given height decreased exponentially with time. Evidence is presented that the driving force for bleeding is the weight of the static water columns above the bleeding point. The pressure exerted by the water columns and the bleeding volume depend on the water-filling status of (communicating) vessels.",10.1111/j.1438-8677.2008.00062.x,True,high,True,high,"[""birch""]","[""lipid barriers"", ""xylem refilling"", ""osmotic pressure""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""birch""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Refilling experiments with benzene, sucrose infusion, electron and light microscopy, as well as (1)H NMR chemical shift microimaging provided evidence that the xylem of birch represents a compartment confined by solute\u2011reflecting barriers (radial: lipid linings/lipid bodies; axial: presumably air\u2011filled spaces).""], ""explanation"": ""The study identifies lipid linings and lipid bodies as key structural components forming solute\u2011reflecting barriers in birch xylem, which influence osmotic pressure gradients and the refilling mechanism of xylem conduits."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid barriers"", ""xylem refilling"", ""osmotic pressure""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",5: Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets,success,5.0,Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets

1560029,Surface structure and properties of plant seed oil bodies.,"Storage triacylglycerols (TAG) in plant seeds are present in small discrete intracellular organelles called oil bodies. An oil body has a matrix of TAG, which is surrounded by phospholipids (PL) and alkaline proteins, termed oleosins. Oil bodies isolated from mature maize (Zea mays) embryos maintained their discreteness, but coalesced after treatment with trypsin but not with phospholipase A2 or C. Phospholipase A2 or C exerted its activity on oil bodies only after the exposed portion of oleosins had been removed by trypsin. Attempts were made to reconstitute oil bodies from their constituents. TAG, either extracted from oil bodies or of a 1:2 molar mixture of triolein and trilinolein, in a dilute buffer were sonicated to produce droplets of sizes similar to those of oil bodies; these droplets were unstable and coalesced rapidly. Addition of oil body PL or dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine, with or without charged stearylamine/stearic acid, or oleosins, to the medium before sonication provided limited stabilization effects to the TAG droplets. High stability was achieved only when the TAG were sonicated with both oil body PL (or dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine) and oleosins of proportions similar to or higher than those in the native oil bodies. These stabilized droplets were similar to the isolated oil bodies in chemical properties, and can be considered as reconstituted oil bodies. Reconstituted oil bodies were also produced from TAG of a 1:2 molar mixture of triolein and trilinolein, dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine, and oleosins from rice (Oryza sativa), wheat (Triticum aestivum), rapeseed (Brassica napus), soybean (Glycine max), or jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis). It is concluded that both oleosins and PL are required to stabilize the oil bodies and that oleosins prevent oil bodies from coalescing by providing steric hindrance.

17132453,Spectroscopic assessment of Australian cotton waxes.,"An investigation into the spectroscopic analysis of cotton waxes on Australian cottons was undertaken. The chemical composition of cotton wax is complex and contains a number of lipid classes. Infrared transmission spectroscopy coupled with principal component analysis was found to be capable of discriminating between solvent-extracted cotton waxes with differences in their alkyl functionality. Based on high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) results, these differences were associated with an increase in levels of the alkane wax component. On the basis of these results, a photo-acoustic spectroscopic method was developed that could be used to distinguish raw cottons on the basis of these differences. This method was utilized to screen cottons from the Cotton Seed Distributors 2001 seed trial. A preliminary assessment of the scouring and dyeing properties of the various cottons, identified using the photo-acoustic method, was carried out. The results tended to confirm that cottons with increased alkyl functionality, most likely associated with alkane wax, were more difficult to remove and residual wax on the fiber acted as a barrier to dyestuff penetration, thus lowering color yield.",10.1366/000370206778999021,True,high,True,high,"[""cotton""]","[""lipid composition"", ""alkane wax""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""cotton""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""The chemical composition of cotton wax is complex and contains a number of lipid classes."", ""Based on high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) results, these differences were associated with an increase in levels of the alkane wax component.""], ""explanation"": ""The study analyzes cotton wax, explicitly mentioning its complex lipid composition and focusing on alkane wax components, indicating direct investigation of lipid classes within plant material."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid composition"", ""alkane wax""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",5: Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets,success,5.0,Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets
8864847,Characterization of seed oil bodies and their surface oleosin isoforms from rice embryos.,"Plant seeds store triacylglycerols in discrete organelles called oil bodies. An oil body stores a matrix of triacylglycerols surrounded by phospholipids and alkaline proteins termed oleosins. Oil bodies in rice seeds are present in embryos and aleurone layers. They do not coalesce in crowded environments, as observed on electron microscopy. The detected isoelectric point of purified rice oil bodies is pH 6.2. This implies that rice oil bodies possess a negatively charged surface at neutral pH. The suspension of rice oil bodies in pH 6.5 buffer induces aggregation. Presumably, the negatively charged surface causes electrostatic repulsion that maintains rice oil bodies as discrete organelles. Rice oil bodies lose their integrity on trypsin treatment. Undoubtedly, oleosins play an important role in the stability of oil bodies. There are two oleosin isoforms in rice oil bodies. Antibodies raised against these two homologous isoforms do not cross-recognize each other. Both isoforms are restricted to oil bodies, as detected on immuno-assaying. Partial amino acid sequences of these two isoforms were obtained, and compared with the deduced sequences of two maize and two rice oleosin genes. The comparison confirmed that the two major proteins in rice oil bodies are the two oleosin isoforms.",10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a021396,True,high,True,high,"[""Oryza sativa""]","[""oil bodies"", ""triacylglycerols"", ""oleosins""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Oryza sativa""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Plant seeds store triacylglycerols in discrete organelles called oil bodies."", ""Oil bodies in rice seeds are present in embryos and aleurone layers.""], ""explanation"": ""The study characterizes oil bodies, which are lipid\u2011rich organelles storing triacylglycerols, and examines the proteins (oleosins) that stabilize them, directly addressing lipid composition and organization."", ""specific_topics"": [""oil bodies"", ""triacylglycerols"", ""oleosins""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",5: Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets,success,5.0,Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets
8981833,[Effect of formation of surface complex between hydroxypropylcellulose and sodium dodecylsulfate on dispersion/flocculation of O/W-type emulsion of soybean oil].,"An O/W-type emulsion of soybean oil (theta v = 0.05) was prepared in the presence of various concentrations of hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC) and sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS). The mean diameter (d) of secondary particles of the oil droplets decreased with concentrations of SDS and HPC after attaining a maximum at [SDS] = 5 mmol/dm3 and [HPC] = 10(-3) g/dl, while the relative viscosity (eta rel) of the emulsion increased with an SDS concentration after attaining a minimum around 5 mmol/dl3 when the HPC concentration was kept constant. These facts were explained in terms of the formulation of a surface complex by hydrophobic interaction between SDS and HPC adsorbed on the surface of the droplets. When the concentration of SDS is low, it bridges between the HPC segments intra- and intermolecularly on and between the particles, resulting in shrinking of the HPC surface layers as well as in bridging among the particles. Therefore, the total volume of the secondary particles effective on eta rel decreases while the d-value increases with the SDS concentration. When the concentration becomes high, binding ratio of SDS to HPC also increases and the segments are repulsive each other owing to the negative charges given by the bound SDS. As a result, the adsorption layer swells and the secondary particles are redispersed. This fact causes an increase in eta rel and a decrease in d-value with a concentration of added SDS.",10.1248/yakushi1947.116.11_892,True,high,True,high,"[""soybean""]","[""emulsion stability"", ""surface complexation"", ""viscosity"", ""droplet size""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""soybean""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""An O/W-type emulsion of soybean oil (theta v = 0.05) was prepared in the presence of various concentrations of hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC) and sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS)."", ""The mean diameter (d) of secondary particles of the oil droplets decreased with concentrations of SDS and HPC after attaining a maximum at [SDS] = 5 mmol/dm3 and [HPC] = 10(-3) g/dl, while the relative viscosity (eta rel) of the emulsion increased with an SDS concentration after attaining a minimum around 5 mmol/dl3 when the HPC concentration was kept constant.""], ""explanation"": ""The study examines the physical behavior of soybean oil droplets in an oil-in-water emulsion, focusing on how surfactant and polymer concentrations affect droplet size and viscosity\u2014key aspects of lipid processing and emulsion technology."", ""specific_topics"": [""emulsion stability"", ""surface complexation"", ""viscosity"", ""droplet size""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",5: Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets,success,5.0,Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets
23940319,Tandem oleosin genes in a cluster acquired in Brassicaceae created tapetosomes and conferred additive benefit of pollen vigor.,"During evolution, genomes expanded via whole-genome, segmental, tandem, and individual-gene duplications, and the emerged redundant paralogs would be eliminated or retained owing to selective neutrality or adaptive benefit and further functional divergence. Here we show that tandem paralogs can contribute adaptive quantitative benefit and thus have been retained in a lineage-specific manner. In Brassicaceae, a tandem oleosin gene cluster of five to nine paralogs encodes ample tapetum-specific oleosins located in abundant organelles called tapetosomes in flower anthers. Tapetosomes coordinate the storage of lipids and flavonoids and their transport to the adjacent maturing pollen as the coat to serve various functions. Transfer-DNA and siRNA mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana with knockout and knockdown of different tandem oleosin paralogs had quantitative and correlated loss of organized structures of the tapetosomes, pollen-coat materials, and pollen tolerance to dehydration. Complementation with the knockout paralog restored the losses. Cleomaceae is the family closest to Brassicaceae. Cleome species did not contain the tandem oleosin gene cluster, tapetum oleosin transcripts, tapetosomes, or pollen tolerant to dehydration. Cleome hassleriana transformed with an Arabidopsis oleosin gene for tapetum expression possessed primitive tapetosomes and pollen tolerant to dehydration. We propose that during early evolution of Brassicaceae, a duplicate oleosin gene mutated from expression in seed to the tapetum. The tapetum oleosin generated primitive tapetosomes that organized stored lipids and flavonoids for their effective transfer to the pollen surface for greater pollen vitality. The resulting adaptive benefit led to retention of tandem-duplicated oleosin genes for production of more oleosin and modern tapetosomes.",10.1073/pnas.1305299110,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana"", ""Cleome hassleriana""]","[""lipid storage"", ""oleosin function"", ""tapetosome formation""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana"", ""Cleome hassleriana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Tapetosomes coordinate the storage of lipids and flavonoids and their transport to the adjacent maturing pollen as the coat to serve various functions."", ""The tapetum oleosin generated primitive tapetosomes that organized stored lipids and flavonoids for their effective transfer to the pollen surface for greater pollen vitality.""], ""explanation"": ""The study focuses on oleosin proteins that bind and organize lipids within tapetosomes, which are essential for delivering lipids and flavonoids to developing pollen, directly implicating lipid metabolism and transport processes."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid storage"", ""oleosin function"", ""tapetosome formation""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",5: Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets,success,5.0,Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets

However, little is known regarding the possible functions of the CLEs in the anther. Here, we show that a T-DNA insertional mutant, and dominant-negative (DN) and overexpression (OX) transgenic plants of the <i>CLE19</i> gene, exhibited significantly reduced anther size and pollen grain number and abnormal pollen wall formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Interestingly, the <i>DN</i>-<i>CLE19</i> pollen grains showed a more extensively covered surface, but <i>CLE19-OX</i> pollen exine exhibited clearly missing connections in the network and lacked separation between areas that normally form the lacunae. With a combination of cell biological, genetic, and transcriptomic analyses on <i>cle19</i>, <i>DN</i>-<i>CLE19</i>, and <i>CLE19-OX</i> plants, we demonstrated that <i>CLE19-OX</i> plants produced highly vacuolated and swollen <i>aborted microspores</i> (<i>ams</i>)-like tapetal cells, lacked lipidic tapetosomes and elaioplasts, and had abnormal pollen primexine without obvious accumulation of sporopollenin precursors.

Tocochromanols and lipids accumulated in parallel until 80% of the final dry weight of the kernels was reached. Later on the tocochromanol content did not change while the lipid content decreased. Generally, only about 13% of the tocochromanols were found in the germ fraction, whereas the pericarp fraction contained about 50% and the endosperm fraction about 37% of the tocochromanols. Altogether, about 85% of the tocochromanols were tocotrienols in both cultivars. In case of the tocopherols about 80% were found in the germ fraction and the remaining 20% in the pericarp fraction.

We recently reported the cloning and temporal-spatial expression of a peanut (Arachis hypogaea) AhLPAT2gene, showing that an increase in AhLPAT2 transcript levels was closely correlated with an increase in seed oil levels. However, the function of the enzyme encoded by the AhLPAT2 gene remains unclear. Here, we report that AhLPAT2 transcript levels were consistently higher in the seeds of a high-oil cultivar than in those of a low-oil cultivar across different seed developmental stages. Seed-specific overexpression of AhLPAT2 in Arabidopsis results in a higher percentage of oil in the seeds and greater-than-average seed weight in the transgenic plants compared with the wild-type plants, leading to a significant increase in total oil yield per plant. The total fatty acid (FA) content and the proportion of unsaturated FAs also increased. In the developing siliques of AhLPAT2-overexpressing plants, the expression levels of genes encoding crucial enzymes involved in de novo FA synthesis, acetyl-CoA subunit (AtBCCP2) and acyl carrier protein 1 (AtACP1) were elevated. AhLPAT2 overexpression also promoted the expression of several key genes related to TAG assembly, sucrose metabolism, and glycolysis.

Additionally, two inbred lines varying in oleic acid content, HA89 (18% oleic) and HA341 (89% oleic), were also analyzed in the same manner. Statistical analyses of these sunflower lines was performed beginning with fitting a mixed effects linear model to the log-transformed optical volume of each spot to account for gel variation, followed by testing the significance between varieties for mean transformed optical spot volumes. The p-values from the spot analysis procedures were then used to find the cutoff point for differential expression using a 10% false-discovery rate (FDR). Comparison of the oil content and oleic acid composition lines revealed 77 and 42 protein spots below the 10% FDR cutoff, respectively, and were therefore declared differentially expressed. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of each of these protein spots resulted in assignments for 44 and 17 spots, respectively. Fructokinase, plastid phosphoglycerate kinase, and enolase proteins were determined to be up-regulated in the high oil line, while phosphofructokinase, cytosolic phosphoglucomutase, and cytsolic phosphoglycerate kinase were up-regulated in the low oil variety. Additionally, four activities involved in amino acid synthesis were up-regulated in the low oil variety in addition to 12S storage proteins and a protein similar to legumin storage protein. Interestingly, two 2-DE spots identified as 14-3-3 proteins were found to be up-regulated in high oleic acid variety.

24014578,Alterations in seed development gene expression affect size and oil content of Arabidopsis seeds.,"Seed endosperm development in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) is under control of the polycomb group complex, which includes Fertilization Independent Endosperm (FIE). The polycomb group complex regulates downstream factors, e.g. Pheres1 (PHE1), by genomic imprinting. In heterozygous fie mutants, an endosperm develops in ovules carrying a maternal fie allele without fertilization, finally leading to abortion. Another endosperm development pathway depends on MINISEED3 (a WRKY10 transcription factor) and HAIKU2 (a leucine-rich repeat kinase). While the role of seed development genes in the embryo and endosperm establishment has been studied in detail, their impact on metabolism and oil accumulation remained unclear. Analysis of oil, protein, and sucrose accumulation in mutants and overexpression plants of the four seed development genes revealed that (1) seeds carrying a maternal fie allele accumulate low oil with an altered composition of triacylglycerol molecular species; (2) homozygous mutant seeds of phe1, mini3, and iku2, which are smaller, accumulate less oil and slightly less protein, and starch, which accumulates early during seed development, remains elevated in mutant seeds; (3) embryo-specific overexpression of FIE, PHE1, and MINI3 has no influence on seed size and weight, nor on oil, protein, or sucrose content; and (4) overexpression of IKU2 results in seeds with increased size and weight, and oil content of overexpressed IKU2 seeds is increased by 35%.

Information on the progress, during the whole achene growth period, of the formation of oil bodies in the components of the achene and its relationship with variations in final oil content is also lacking. The biomass dynamics of achene components (pericarp, embryo, oil) in three cultivars of very different final oil concentration (30-56 % oil) were studied. In parallel, anatomical sections were used to follow the formation of oil and protein bodies in the embryo, and to observe pericarp anatomy. In all cultivars, oil bodies were first observed in the embryo 6-7 daa after anthesis (daa). The per-cell number of oil bodies increased rapidly from 10-12 daa until 25-30 daa. Oil bodies were absent from the outer cell layers of young fruit and from mature pericarps. In mature embryos, the proportion of cell cross-sectional area occupied by protein bodies increased with decreasing embryo oil concentration. The sclerenchymatic layer of the mature pericarp decreased in thickness and number of cell layers from the low-oil cultivar to the high-oil cultivar. Different patterns of oil accumulation in the embryo across cultivars were also found, leading to variations in ripe embryo oil concentration. In the high-oil cultivar, the end of oil deposition coincided with cessation of embryo growth, while in the other two cultivars oil ceased to accumulate before the embryo achieved maximum weight. Cultivar differences in mature achene oil concentration reflect variations in pericarp proportion and thickness and mature embryo oil concentration.

Soybean oil and protein contents are quantitatively inherited and significantly affected by environmental factors. In this study, meta-analysis was conducted based on soybean physical maps to integrate quantitative trait loci (QTLs) from multiple experiments in different environments. Meta-QTLs for seed oil, fatty acid composition, and protein were identified. Of them, 11 meta-QTLs were located on hot regions for both seed oil and protein. Next, we selected 4 chromosome segment substitution lines with different seed oil and protein contents to characterize their 3 years of phenotype selection in the field. Using strand-specific RNA-sequencing analysis, we profile the time-course transcriptome patterns of soybean seeds at early maturity, middle maturity, and dry seed stages. Pairwise comparison and K-means clustering analysis revealed 7,482 differentially expressed genes and 45 expression patterns clusters. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis uncovered 46 modules of gene expression patterns.

28125283,"Plastoglobuli: Plastid Microcompartments with Integrated Functions in Metabolism, Plastid Developmental Transitions, and Environmental Adaptation.","Plastoglobuli (PGs) are plastid lipoprotein particles surrounded by a membrane lipid monolayer. PGs contain small specialized proteomes and metabolomes. They are present in different plastid types (e.g., chloroplasts, chromoplasts, and elaioplasts) and are dynamic in size and shape in response to abiotic stress or developmental transitions. PGs in chromoplasts are highly enriched in carotenoid esters and enzymes involved in carotenoid metabolism. PGs in chloroplasts are associated with thylakoids and contain ∼30 core proteins (including six ABC1 kinases) as well as additional proteins recruited under specific conditions. Systems analysis has suggested that chloroplast PGs function in metabolism of prenyl lipids (e.g., tocopherols, plastoquinone, and phylloquinone); redox and photosynthetic regulation; plastid biogenesis; and senescence, including recycling of phytol, remobilization of thylakoid lipids, and metabolism of jasmonate. These functionalities contribute to chloroplast PGs' role in responses to stresses such as high light and nitrogen starvation. PGs are thus lipid microcompartments with multiple functions integrated into plastid metabolism, developmental transitions, and environmental adaptation.

29193665,Provitamin A biofortification of cassava enhances shelf life but reduces dry matter content of storage roots due to altered carbon partitioning into starch.,"Storage roots of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz), a major subsistence crop of sub-Saharan Africa, are calorie rich but deficient in essential micronutrients, including provitamin A β-carotene. In this study, β-carotene concentrations in cassava storage roots were enhanced by co-expression of transgenes for deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) and bacterial phytoene synthase (crtB), mediated by the patatin-type 1 promoter. Storage roots harvested from field-grown plants accumulated carotenoids to ≤50 μg/g DW, 15- to 20-fold increases relative to roots from nontransgenic plants. Approximately 85%-90% of these carotenoids accumulated as all-trans-β-carotene, the most nutritionally efficacious carotenoid. β-Carotene-accumulating storage roots displayed delayed onset of postharvest physiological deterioration, a major constraint limiting utilization of cassava products. Large metabolite changes were detected in β-carotene-enhanced storage roots. Most significantly, an inverse correlation was observed between β-carotene and dry matter content, with reductions of 50%-60% of dry matter content in the highest carotenoid-accumulating storage roots of different cultivars. Further analysis confirmed a concomitant reduction in starch content and increased levels of total fatty acids, triacylglycerols, soluble sugars and abscisic acid. Potato engineered to co-express DXS and crtB displayed a similar correlation between β-carotene accumulation, reduced dry matter and starch content and elevated oil and soluble sugars in tubers. Transcriptome analyses revealed a reduced expression of genes involved in starch biosynthesis including ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase genes in transgenic, carotene-accumulating cassava roots relative to nontransgenic roots.

Spontaneous emulsification was carried out by titrating an organic phase (oil and phospholipid) into an aqueous phase with continuous stirring. The influence of phospholipid composition, surfactant-to-oil ratio (SOR), initial phospholipids location, storage time, phospholipid type, and preparation method was tested. The initial droplet size depended on the nature of the phospholipid used, which was attributed to differences in phospholipid composition. Droplet size decreased with increasing SOR and was smallest when the phospholipid was fully dissolved in the organic phase rather than the aqueous phase. The droplets formed using spontaneous emulsification were relatively large (d > 10 μm), and so the emulsions were unstable to gravitational separation. At low SORs (0.1 and 0.5), emulsions produced with phospholipids had a smaller particle diameter than those produced with a synthetic surfactant (Tween 80), but at a higher SOR (1.0), this trend was reversed. High-energy methods (microfluidization and sonication) formed significantly smaller droplets (d < 10 μm) than spontaneous emulsification.

The three different matrices tested (olive oil, olives and avocado) were partitioned using acetonitrile prior to cleanup step. Afterwards, the supernatant was purified using different sorbents: C18+PSA (primary secondary amine), Z-Sep(+) (zirconium oxide and C18 dual bonded to silica), Z-Sep (zirconium oxide bonded to silica) and a novel sorbent Enhanced Matrix Removal-Lipid (EMR) whose composition has not been disclosed. The different cleanup strategies were compared for a group of 67 representative pesticides in terms of recovery rates, matrix effects, extract cleanliness and precision using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). The best extraction efficiencies in olive oil matrix were obtained using EMR, while the results for olives and avocado were pretty similar amongst the different sorbents with an overall lower performance in terms of matrix effects and recovery rates compared to olive oil data, particularly in olives due to the higher complexity and concentration of coextracted species. On the other hand, the average reproducibility was clearly better when EMR sorbent was employed in all selected matrices for most pesticides (RSD<10% for 45, 52, and 56 pesticides in avocado, olives and olive oil respectively). The best results in terms of matrix effects were also obtained with EMR; with signal suppression lower than 20% for 79%, 16% and 51% of pesticides tested in olive oil, olives and avocado respectively. Using EMR as cleanup sorbent, limits of quantitation using UHPLC-MS/MS, ranged from 0.10 to 90μgkg(-1), allowing their determination at the low concentration levels demanded by current olive oil regulations in most cases.",10.1016/j.chroma.2016.06.019,True,high,True,high,"[""Olea europaea"", ""Persea americana""]","[""lipid removal"", ""matrix effects"", ""cleanup sorbents"", ""EMR""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Olea europaea"", ""Persea americana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""In this article we have evaluated the performance of different sorbents for the cleanup step in multiresidue pesticide analysis in fatty vegetable matrices using QuEChERS methodology."", ""a novel sorbent Enhanced Matrix Removal-Lipid (EMR) whose composition has not been disclosed.""], ""explanation"": ""The study specifically addresses the removal of lipids from fatty vegetable matrices (olive oil, olives, avocado) during pesticide residue analysis, employing a specialized sorbent designed for lipid removal (EMR).

18485063,A novel role for oleosins in freezing tolerance of oilseeds in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"Oil bodies in seeds of higher plants are surrounded with oleosins. Here we demonstrate a novel role for oleosins in protecting oilseeds against freeze/thaw-induced damage of their cells. We detected four oleosins in oil bodies isolated from seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana, and designated them OLE1, OLE2, OLE3 and OLE4 in decreasing order of abundance in the seeds. For reverse genetics, we isolated oleosin-deficient mutants (ole1, ole2, ole3 and ole4) and generated three double mutants (ole1 ole2, ole1 ole3 and ole2 ole3). Electron microscopy showed an inverse relationship between oil body sizes and total oleosin levels. The double mutant ole1 ole2, which had the lowest levels of oleosins, had irregular enlarged oil-containing structures throughout the seed cells. Germination rates were positively associated with oleosin levels, suggesting that defects in germination are related to the expansion of oil bodies due to oleosin deficiency. We found that freezing followed by imbibition at 4 degrees C abolished seed germination of single mutants (ole1, ole2 and ole3), which germinated normally without freezing treatment. The treatment accelerated the fusion of oil bodies and the abnormal-positioning and deformation of nuclei in ole1 seeds, which caused seed mortality. In contrast, ole1 seeds that had undergone freezing treatment germinated normally when incubated at 22 degrees C instead of 4 degrees C, because degradation of oils abolished the acceleration of fusion of oil bodies during imbibition. Taken together, our findings suggest that oleosins increase the viability of over-wintering oilseeds by preventing abnormal fusion of oil bodies during imbibition in the spring.",10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03553.x,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""oleosin function"", ""oil body dynamics"", ""freezing tolerance in seeds""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Oil bodies in seeds of higher plants are surrounded with oleosins."", ""Electron microscopy showed an inverse relationship between oil body sizes and total oleosin levels.""], ""explanation"": ""The study examines oleosins, proteins that coat oil bodies\u2014lipid storage organelles\u2014in Arabidopsis seeds, investigating how these proteins influence oil body size, fusion, and seed viability under freezing conditions, thereby addressing lipid-related cellular processes."", ""specific_topics"": [""oleosin function"", ""oil body dynamics"", ""freezing tolerance in seeds""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",5: Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets,success,5.0,Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets
28028582,Genetic dissection of sorghum grain quality traits using diverse and segregating populations.,"Coordinated association and linkage mapping identified 25 grain quality QTLs in multiple environments, and fine mapping of the Wx locus supports the use of high-density genetic markers in linkage mapping. There is a wide range of end-use products made from cereal grains, and these products often demand different grain characteristics. Fortunately, cereal crop species including sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] contain high phenotypic variation for traits influencing grain quality. Identifying genetic variants underlying this phenotypic variation allows plant breeders to develop genotypes with grain attributes optimized for their intended usage. Multiple sorghum mapping populations were rigorously phenotyped across two environments (SC Coastal Plain and Central TX) in 2 years for five major grain quality traits: amylose, starch, crude protein, crude fat, and gross energy. Coordinated association and linkage mapping revealed several robust QTLs that make prime targets to improve grain quality for food, feed, and fuel products. Although the amylose QTL interval spanned many megabases, the marker with greatest significance was located just 12 kb from waxy (Wx), the primary gene regulating amylose production in cereal grains. This suggests higher resolution mapping in recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations can be obtained when genotyped at a high marker density. The major QTL for crude fat content, identified in both a RIL population and grain sorghum diversity panel, encompassed the DGAT1 locus, a critical gene involved in maize lipid biosynthesis. Another QTL on chromosome 1 was consistently mapped in both RIL populations for multiple grain quality traits including starch, crude protein, and gross energy. Collectively, these genetic regions offer excellent opportunities to manipulate grain composition and set up future studies for gene validation.",10.1007/s00122-016-2844-6,True,high,True,high,"[""Sorghum bicolor""]","[""crude fat content"", ""DGAT1 locus"", ""lipid biosynthesis""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Sorghum bicolor""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Multiple sorghum mapping populations were rigorously phenotyped across two environments (SC Coastal Plain and Central TX) in 2 years for five major grain quality traits: amylose, starch, crude protein, crude fat, and gross energy."", ""The major QTL for crude fat content, identified in both a RIL population and grain sorghum diversity panel, encompassed the DGAT1 locus, a critical gene involved in maize lipid biosynthesis.""], ""explanation"": ""The study explicitly measures crude fat as a grain quality trait and identifies a QTL encompassing DGAT1, a key enzyme in triacylglycerol synthesis, demonstrating direct investigation of lipid-related genetics."", ""specific_topics"": [""crude fat content"", ""DGAT1 locus"", ""lipid biosynthesis""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",5: Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets,success,5.0,Lipid Storage & Lipid Droplets

11308368,Carotenoid esters in vegetables and fruits: a screening with emphasis on beta-cryptoxanthin esters.,"Carotenoids are found in food plants in free form or as fatty acid esters. Most studies have been carried out after saponification procedures, so the resulting data do not represent the native carotenoid composition of plant tissues. Therefore, nonsaponified extracts of 64 fruits and vegetables have been screened to determine the amount of carotenoid esters in food plants. Because one of the major problems in the quantitation of carotenoids is the availability of pure standard material, the total carotenoid ester content was calculated as lutein dimyristate equivalents. Lutein dimyristate was independently synthesized from lutein and myristoyl chloride. The highest ester concentrations were found in red chili (17.1 mg/100 g) and orange pepper (9.2 mg/100 g); most of the investigated fruits and vegetables showed concentrations up to 1.5 mg/100 g. Special attention was dedicated to beta-cryptoxanthin esters. To enable an accurate detection of the beta-cryptoxanthin ester content, beta-cryptoxanthin was purified from papaya and used for synthesis of beta-cryptoxanthin laurate, myristate, and palmitate, representing the major beta-cryptoxanthin esters in food plants. The study proved tropical and subtropical fruits to be an additional source of beta-cryptoxanthin esters in the human diet.

By using large-scale MS-based metabolite profiling of primary, secondary and lipid compounds in combination with array-based transcript profiling, we show that the TOR protein not only regulates growth but also influences nutrient partitioning and central energy metabolism. The study was performed on plants exhibiting conditional down-regulation of AtTOR expression, revealing strong regulation of genes involved in pathways such as the cell cycle, cell-wall modifications and senescence, together with major changes in transcripts and metabolites of the primary and secondary metabolism. In agreement with these results, our morphological and metabolic analyses disclosed major metabolic changes leading to massive accumulations of storage lipids and starch. The implications of these data in the context of the general role of TOR in eukaryotic systems are discussed in parallel with the plant-specific aspects of TOR function.

23637973,Seed structure characteristics to form ultrahigh oil content in rapeseed.,"Rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) is an important oil crop in the world, and increasing its oil content is a major breeding goal. The studies on seed structure and characteristics of different oil content rapeseed could help us to understand the biological mechanism of lipid accumulation, and be helpful for rapeseed breeding. Here we report on the seed ultrastructure of an ultrahigh oil content rapeseed line YN171, whose oil content is 64.8%, and compared with other high and low oil content rapeseed lines. The results indicated that the cytoplasms of cotyledon, radicle, and aleuronic cells were completely filled with oil and protein bodies, and YN171 had a high oil body organelle to cell area ratio for all cell types. In the cotyledon cells, oil body organelles comprised 81% of the total cell area in YN171, but only 53 to 58% in three high oil content lines and 33 to 38% in three low oil content lines. The high oil body organelle to cotyledon cell area ratio and the cotyledon ratio in seed were the main reasons for the ultrahigh oil content of YN171. The correlation analysis indicated that oil content is significantly negatively correlated with protein content, but is not correlated with fatty acid composition. Our results indicate that the oil content of YN171 could be enhanced by increasing the oil body organelle to cell ratio for some cell types. The oil body organelle to seed ratio significantly highly positively correlates with oil content, and could be used to predict seed oil content. Based on the structural analysis of different oil content rapeseed lines, we estimate the maximum of rapeseed oil content could reach 75%.

29967047,<i>HEAT INDUCIBLE LIPASE1</i> Remodels Chloroplastic Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol by Liberating α-Linolenic Acid in Arabidopsis Leaves under Heat Stress.,"Under heat stress, polyunsaturated acyl groups, such as α-linolenate (18:3) and hexadecatrienoate (16:3), are removed from chloroplastic glycerolipids in various plant species. Here, we showed that a lipase designated HEAT INDUCIBLE LIPASE1 (HIL1) induces the catabolism of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) under heat stress in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> leaves. Using thermotolerance tests, a T-DNA insertion mutant with disrupted <i>HIL1</i> was shown to have a heat stress-sensitive phenotype. Lipidomic analysis indicated that the decrease of 34:6-MGDG under heat stress was partially impaired in the <i>hil1</i> mutant. Concomitantly, the heat-induced increment of 54:9-triacylglycerol in the <i>hil1</i> mutant was 18% lower than that in the wild-type plants. Recombinant HIL1 protein digested MGDG to produce 18:3-free fatty acid (18:3-FFA), but not 18:0- and 16:0-FFAs.

10890894,An ethylene-induced cDNA encoding a lipase expressed at the onset of senescence.,"A cDNA clone encoding a lipase (lipolytic acyl hydrolase) expressed at the onset of petal senescence has been isolated by screening a cDNA expression library prepared from carnation flowers (Dianthus caryophyllus). The cDNA contains the lipase consensus sequence, ITFAGHSLGA, and encodes a 447-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 50.2 kDa that appears to be a cytosolic protein. Over-expression of the clone in Escherichia coli yielded a protein of the expected molecular weight that proved capable of deesterifying fatty acids from p-nitrophenylpalmitate, tri-linolein, soybean phospholipid, and Tween in both in vitro and in situ assays of enzyme activity. The abundance of the lipase mRNA increases just as carnation flowers begin to senesce, and expression of the gene is also induced by treatment with ethylene. Southern blot analyses of carnation genomic DNA have indicated that the lipase is a single copy gene. The lipase gene is also expressed in carnation leaves and is up-regulated when the leaves are treated with ethylene. Deesterification of membrane lipids and ensuing loss of membrane structural integrity are well established early events of plant senescence, and the expression pattern of this lipase gene together with the lipolytic activity of its cognate protein indicate that it plays a fundamentally central role in mediating the onset of senescence.",10.1073/pnas.140213697,True,high,True,high,"[""Dianthus caryophyllus""]","[""lipase activity"", ""fatty acid hydrolysis"", ""membrane lipid degradation""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Dianthus caryophyllus""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Over\u2011expression of the clone in Escherichia coli yielded a protein of the expected molecular weight that proved capable of deesterifying fatty acids from p\u2011nitrophenylpalmitate, tri\u2011linolein, soybean phospholipid, and Tween in both in vitro and in situ assays of enzyme activity."", ""Deesterification of membrane lipids and ensuing loss of membrane structural integrity are well established early events of plant senescence.""], ""explanation"": ""The study characterizes a lipase that hydrolyzes fatty acids and membrane lipids, directly implicating lipid metabolism in flower senescence."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipase activity"", ""fatty acid hydrolysis"", ""membrane lipid degradation""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",6: Membrane Lipid Remodeling,success,6.0,Membrane Lipid Remodeling
21167812,Plant pentacyclic triterpenic acids as modulators of lipid membrane physical properties.,"Free triterpenic acids (TTPs) present in plants are bioactive compounds exhibiting multiple nutriceutical activities. The underlying molecular mechanisms have only been examined in part and mainly focused on anti-inflammatory properties, cancer and cardiovascular diseases, in all of which TTPs frequently affect membrane-related proteins. Based on the structural characteristics of TTPs, we assume that their effect on biophysical properties of cell membranes could play a role for their biological activity. In this context, our study is focused on the compounds, oleanolic (3β-hydroxy-12-oleanen-28-oic acid, OLA), maslinic (2α,3β-dihydroxy-12-oleanen-28-oic acid, MSL) and ursolic ((3β)-3-hydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid, URL) as the most important TTPs present in orujo olive oil. X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, (31)P nuclear magnetic resonance and Laurdan fluorescence data provide experimental evidence that OLA, MSL and URL altered the structural properties of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and DPPC-Cholesterol (Cho) rich membranes, being located into the polar-hydrophobic interphase. Specifically, in DPPC membranes, TTPs altered the structural order of the L(β'), phase without destabilizing the lipid bilayer. The existence of a nonbilayer isotropic phase in coexistence with the liquid crystalline L(α) phase, as observed in DPPC:URL samples, indicated the presence of lipid structures with high curvature (probably inverted micelles). In DPPC:Cho membranes, TTPs affected the membrane phase properties increasing the Laurdan GP values above 40°C. MSL and URL induced segregation of Cho within the bilayer, in contrast to OLA, that reduced the structural organization of the membrane. These results strengthen the relevance of TTP interactions with cell membranes as a molecular mechanism underlying their broad spectrum of biological effects.",10.1016/j.bbamem.2010.12.007,True,high,True,high,"[""Olea europaea""]","[""lipid bilayer structure"", ""lipid phase transitions"", ""lipid curvature""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Olea europaea""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""X\u2011ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, (31)P nuclear magnetic resonance and Laurdan fluorescence data provide experimental evidence that OLA, MSL and URL altered the structural properties of 1,2\u2011dipalmitoyl\u2011sn\u2011glycero\u20113\u2011phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and DPPC\u2011Cholesterol (Cho) rich membranes, being located into the polar\u2011hydrophobic interphase."", ""The existence of a nonbilayer isotropic phase in coexistence with the liquid crystalline L(\u03b1) phase, as observed in DPPC:URL samples, indicated the presence of lipid structures with high curvature (probably inverted micelles).""], ""explanation"": ""The study examines how plant-derived triterpenic acids modify the physical properties of phospholipid bilayers, directly addressing lipid membrane structure, phase behavior, and curvature phenomena."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid bilayer structure"", ""lipid phase transitions"", ""lipid curvature""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",6: Membrane Lipid Remodeling,success,6.0,Membrane Lipid Remodeling

9437863,Antisense suppression of phospholipase D alpha retards abscisic acid- and ethylene-promoted senescence of postharvest Arabidopsis leaves.,"Membrane disruption has been proposed to be a key event in plant senescence, and phospholipase D (PLD; EC 3.1.4.4) has been thought to play an important role in membrane deterioration. We recently cloned and biochemically characterized three different PLDs from Arabidopsis. In this study, we investigated the role of the most prevalent phospholipid-hydrolyzing enzyme, PLD alpha, in membrane degradation and senescence in Arabidopsis. The expression of PLD alpha was suppressed by introducing a PLD alpha antisense cDNA fragment into Arabidopsis. When incubated with abscisic acid and ethylene, leaves detached from the PLD alpha-deficient transgenic plants showed a slower rate of senescence than did those from wild-type and transgenic control plants. The retardation of senescence was demonstrated by delayed leaf yellowing, lower ion leakage, greater photosynthetic activity, and higher content of chlorophyll and phospholipids in the PLD alpha antisense leaves than in those of the wild type. Treatment of detached leaves with abscisic acid and ethylene stimulated PLD alpha expression, as indicated by increases in PLD alpha mRNA, protein, and activity. In the absence of abscisic acid and ethylene, however, detached leaves from the PLD alpha-deficient and wild-type plants showed a similar rate of senescence. In addition, the suppression of PLD alpha did not alter natural plant growth and development. These data suggest that PLD alpha is an important mediator in phytohormone-promoted senescence in detached leaves but is not a direct promoter of natural senescence.

8110809,In vitro oxygenation of soybean biomembranes by lipoxygenase-2.,"The ability of soybean lipoxygenases-1 and -2 to oxygenate biomembranes isolated from soybean seedlings has been investigated. Constituents of the lipid bilayer were analyzed by means of reversed phase and chiral phase high performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, high performance thin layer chromatography and uv spectroscopy. Evidence is presented that soybean lipoxygenase-2, at variance with the type-1 enzyme, oxygenates the esterified unsaturated fatty acid moieties in biomembranes, whereas membrane-embedded free unsaturated fatty acid moieties were not a suitable substrate for either isoenzyme. The oxygenation products derived from the biomembranes were the 9- and 13-hydroperoxides of linoleic acid residues, in a molar ratio of 1.0 to 1.7, and the 9- and 13-hydroperoxides of alpha-linolenic acid residues, in a molar ratio of 1.0 to 0.1. The R/S ratios of 13-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid and 9-hydroperoxy-10E,12Z,15Z-octadecatrienoic acid were found to be 0.5 and 25.0, respectively. These stereospecificity values were much higher than those of hydroperoxides isolated after incubation of lipoxygenase-2 with non-membraneous fatty acids or their methyl esters. The hydroperoxy fatty acids produced were distributed in neutral lipids and phospholipids isolated from soybean membranes, the former being oxidized to a larger extent. Furthermore, both intracellular and plasma membranes were substrates for the enzymic oxygenation, with a preference for those of chloroplasts followed by those of Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane and mitochondria. These data point towards a different action of the two lipoxygenases in soybean cells. We suggest that the type-2 enzyme plays a role in the in vivo remodelling of biomembranes.

During hydrogenation the orientational ordering of membrane lipids, as measured with the C-12 positional isomer of spin-labelled stearic acid, displayed a slight increase in agreement with the alterations in membrane composition. Progressive saturation of double bonds of lipids primarily inhibits electron transport between the photosystems followed by the inhibition of electron flow around photosystem II.

12680783,Structural consequences of genetically engineered saturation of the fatty acids of phosphatidylglycerol in tobacco thylakoid membranes. An FTIR study.,"The role of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) in protein-lipid interactions and membrane dynamics has been studied in the thylakoids of wild type and manipulated tobacco plants transformed with complementary DNAs for glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases (GPATs) from squash and Arabidopsis. The expression of the foreign enzymes resulted in the level of saturation of the PG molecules being higher in the squash and lower in the Arabidopsis transformants, as compared with the level in wild-type tobacco. For the analysis of fatty acyl chain dynamics in the thylakoid membranes, the nu(sym)CH(2) vibration bands of the infrared specta were decomposed into two components, corresponding to ordered and disordered fatty acyl chain segments. With this approach, it was shown that in squash GPAT-transformed tobacco thylakoids a rigid lipid domain exists below 25 degrees C. Above 25 degrees C, the dynamics of all thylakoid membranes were very similar, regardless of the manipulations. PG seems to tune the dynamics at the protein-lipid interface rather than to affect the structure of the proteins directly. Above 50 degrees C, the frequencies of the disordered nu(sym)CH(2) component bands were decreased. This lipid-related phenomenon correlated with protein denaturing. It is demonstrated that the protein aggregation appearing upon heat denaturing changes the conformational distribution of the disordered lipid population. The data also reveal that the protein stability does not depend on the fatty acid composition of the PG molecules; other lipids should provide the environment governing the protein stability in the thylakoid membrane.

Herein, we comparatively profiled changes of membrane lipids during imbibition under normal and chilling temperatures in chilling-tolerant and -sensitive soybean seeds. We found three patterns of dynamic lipid remodelling during the three phases of germination. Pattern 1 involved a gradual increase in plastidic lipids during phases I and II, with an abrupt increase during phase III. This abrupt increase was associated with initiation of photosynthesis. Pattern 3 involved phosphatidic acid (PA) first decreasing, then increasing, and finally decreasing to a low level.

This review describes the viral replication process based on tombusviruses, highlighting common strategies with other plant and animal viruses. Overall, the works on Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) have revealed intriguing and complex functions of co-opted cellular translation factors, heat shock proteins, DEAD-box helicases, lipid transfer proteins, and membrane-deforming proteins in virus replication. The emerging picture is that many of the co-opted host factors are from highly expressed and conserved protein families. By hijacking host proteins, phospholipids, sterols, and the actin network, TBSV exerts supremacy over the host cell to support viral replication in large replication compartments. Altogether, these advances in our understanding of tombusvirus-host interactions are broadly applicable to many other viruses, which also usurp conserved host factors for various viral processes.",10.1146/annurev-virology-110615-042312,True,high,True,high,"[""Solanum lycopersicum""]","[""lipid transfer proteins"", ""phospholipids"", ""sterols"", ""membrane remodeling""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Solanum lycopersicum""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Overall, the works on Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) have revealed intriguing and complex functions of co\u2011opted cellular translation factors, heat shock proteins, DEAD-box helicases, lipid transfer proteins, and membrane\u2011deforming proteins in virus replication."", ""By hijacking host proteins, phospholipids, sterols, and the actin network, TBSV exerts supremacy over the host cell to support viral replication in large replication compartments.""], ""explanation"": ""The study explicitly discusses lipid transfer proteins, phospholipids, sterols, and membrane\u2011deforming mechanisms involved in tombusvirus replication, indicating a focus on lipid biology within the context of plant-virus interaction."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid transfer proteins"", ""phospholipids"", ""sterols"", ""membrane remodeling""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",6: Membrane Lipid Remodeling,success,6.0,Membrane Lipid Remodeling

Functionally, the dgd1 mutant exhibited a significantly lower light-dependent, steady-state oxidation level of P700 (P700(+)) in vivo, a higher intersystem electron pool size, restricted linear electron transport and a higher rate of reduction of P700(+) in the dark, indicating an increased capacity for PSI cyclic electron transfer compared with the wild type. Concomitantly, the dgd1 mutant exhibited a higher sensitivity to and incomplete recovery of photoinhibition of PSI. Furthermore, dgd1 exhibited a lower capacity to undergo state transitions compared with the wild type, which was associated with a higher reduction state of the plastoquinone (PQ) pool. We conclude that digalactosyl-diacylglycerol (DGDG) deficiency results in PSI acceptor-side limitations that alter the flux of electrons through the photosynthetic electron chain and impair the regulation of distribution of excitation energy between the photosystems.

Transcript data were analysed with MapMan software to identify coordinated, system-wide changes in metabolism and other cellular processes. Phosphorus (P) deprivation led to induction or repression of > 1000 genes involved in many processes. A subset, including the induction of genes involved in P uptake, the mobilization of organic Pi, the conversion of phosphorylated glycolytic intermediates to carbohydrates and organic acids, the replacement of P-containing phospholipids with galactolipids and the repression of genes involved in nucleotide/nucleic acid synthesis, was reversed within 3 h after Pi re-supply. Analyses of 22 enzyme activities revealed that changes in transcript levels often, but not always, led to changes in the activities of the encoded enzymes in P-deprived plants. Analyses of metabolites confirmed that P deprivation leads to a shift towards the accumulation of carbohydrates, organic acids and amino acids, and that Pi re-supply leads to use of the latter. P-deprived plants also showed large changes in the expression of many genes involved in, for example, secondary metabolism and photosynthesis. These changes were not reversed rapidly upon Pi re-supply and were probably secondary in origin. Differentially expressed and highly P-specific putative regulator genes were identified that presumably play central roles in coordinating the complex responses of plants to changes in P nutrition. The specific responses to Pi differ markedly from those found for nitrate, whereas the long-term responses during P and N deprivation share common and non-specific features.",10.1111/j.1365-3040.2006.01608.x,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""lipid remodeling"", ""phospholipid substitution"", ""galactolipids""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""A subset, including the induction of genes involved in P uptake, the mobilization of organic Pi, the conversion of phosphorylated glycolytic intermediates to carbohydrates and organic acids, the replacement of P\u2011containing phospholipids with galactolipids and the repression of genes involved in nucleotide/nucleic acid synthesis, was reversed within 3 h after Pi re\u2011supply.""], ""explanation"": ""The study explicitly reports a switch from phosphatidyl\u2011based phospholipids to galactolipids as part of the plant\u2019s metabolic adjustment to phosphorus limitation, indicating investigation of lipid remodeling."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid remodeling"", ""phospholipid substitution"", ""galactolipids""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",6: Membrane Lipid Remodeling,success,6.0,Membrane Lipid Remodeling

26782026,Two phases of response to long-term moderate heat: Variation in thermotolerance between Arabidopsis thaliana and its relative Arabis paniculata.,"Long-term moderate heat is often experienced by plants and will become even more common in the future due to global warming. However, the responses of plants to this stress have not been characterised. In the present study, growth between Arabidopsis thaliana and its relative Arabis paniculata upon long-term exposure to moderate heat was compared. It was found that the latter was more tolerant than the former, and the patterns of physiological and biochemical responses of both plants presented two phases. The early phase involved no significant visible morphological and physiological changes. It occurred during the first third of the heat treatment and was extended when the stress was attenuated. During the later phase, the plants died or were damaged. Heat shock proteins were dramatically induced at the early phase and gradually decreased at the later phase in A. thaliana. By contrast, the levels were induced and maintained in A. paniculata. Profiling of membrane lipids found that the two plants exhibited opposite patterns of lipid remodelling at the early phase: A. paniculata synthesised phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol and showed a rapid decrease in the degree of lipid unsaturation, while A. thaliana degraded its lipids at the early phase and showed an accelerated degradation at the later phase. These biochemical adjustments during the early phase could favor the thermotolerance of A. paniculata. These results suggest that this species could thus be a model for the study of resistance to long-term moderate heat, through a strategy by which plants can adapt to long-term moderate heat.",10.1016/j.phytochem.2016.01.003,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana"", ""Arabis paniculata""]","[""lipid remodeling"", ""phospholipid synthesis"", ""lipid unsaturation"", ""membrane lipid dynamics""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana"", ""Arabis paniculata""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Profiling of membrane lipids found that the two plants exhibited opposite patterns of lipid remodelling at the early phase:"", ""A. paniculata synthesised phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol and showed a rapid decrease in the degree of lipid unsaturation,"", ""while A. thaliana degraded its lipids at the early phase and showed an accelerated degradation at the later phase.""], ""explanation"": ""The study explicitly profiles membrane lipid composition and observes differential lipid remodeling and unsaturation changes in two plant species under prolonged moderate heat stress."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid remodeling"", ""phospholipid synthesis"", ""lipid unsaturation"", ""membrane lipid dynamics""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",6: Membrane Lipid Remodeling,success,6.0,Membrane Lipid Remodeling

Here, we address the question of the role of phytosterols in the organization of the plant PM. The sterol composition of tobacco BY-2 cell PM was determined by gas chromatography. The cyclic oligosaccharide methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, commonly used in animal cells to decrease cholesterol levels, caused a drastic reduction (50%) in the PM total free sterol content of the plant material, without modification in amounts of steryl-conjugates. Fluorescence spectroscopy experiments using DPH, TMA-DPH, Laurdan, and di-4-ANEPPDHQ indicated that such a depletion in sterol content increased lipid acyl chain disorder and reduced the overall liquid-phase heterogeneity in correlation with the disruption of phytosterol-rich domains. Methyl-beta-cyclodextrin also prevented isolation of a PM fraction resistant to solubilization by nonionic detergents, previously characterized in tobacco, and induced redistribution of the proteic marker of this fraction, NtrbohD, within the membrane.

16762032,Membrane lipid alteration during phosphate starvation is regulated by phosphate signaling and auxin/cytokinin cross-talk.,"During phosphate (Pi) starvation in plants, membrane phospholipid content decreases concomitantly with an increase in non-phosphorus glycolipids. Although several studies have indicated the involvement of phytohormones in various physiological changes upon Pi starvation, the regulation of Pi-starvation induced membrane lipid alteration remains unknown. Previously, we reported the response of type B monogalactosyl diacylglycerol synthase genes (atMGD2 and atMGD3) to Pi starvation, and suggested a role for these genes in galactolipid accumulation during Pi starvation. We now report our investigation of the regulatory mechanism for the response of atMGD2/3 and changes in membrane lipid composition to Pi starvation. Exogenous auxin activated atMGD2/3 expression during Pi starvation, whereas their expression was repressed by cytokinin treatment in the root. Moreover, auxin inhibitors and the axr4 aux1 double mutation in auxin signaling impaired the increase of atMGD2/3 expression during Pi starvation, showing that auxin is required for atMGD2/3 activation. The fact that hormonal effects during Pi starvation were also observed with regard to changes in membrane lipid composition demonstrates that both auxin and cytokinin are indeed involved in the dynamic changes in membrane lipids during Pi starvation. Phosphite is not metabolically available in plants; however, when we supplied phosphite to Pi-starved plants, the Pi-starvation response disappeared with respect to both atMGD2/3 expression and changes in membrane lipids. These results indicate that the observed global change in plant membranes during Pi starvation is not caused by Pi-starvation induced damage in plant cells but rather is strictly regulated by Pi signaling and auxin/cytokinin cross-talk.",10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02778.x,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""phosphate starvation"", ""auxin/cytokinin signaling"", ""membrane lipid composition"", ""galactolipid synthesis""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""During phosphate (Pi) starvation in plants, membrane phospholipid content decreases concomitantly with an increase in non-phosphorus glycolipids."", ""The fact that hormonal effects during Pi starvation were also observed with regard to changes in membrane lipid composition demonstrates that both auxin and cytokinin are indeed involved in the dynamic changes in membrane lipids during Pi starvation.""], ""explanation"": ""The study examines how phosphate starvation alters membrane lipid composition, focusing on phospholipids, glycolipids, and the enzymes (atMGD2/3) involved in galactolipid synthesis, thereby directly addressing lipid metabolism."", ""specific_topics"": [""phosphate starvation"", ""auxin/cytokinin signaling"", ""membrane lipid composition"", ""galactolipid synthesis""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",6: Membrane Lipid Remodeling,success,6.0,Membrane Lipid Remodeling

These results further support the hypothesis of Triton X-100/4 M urea, pH 8, as a useful extracting medium for membrane lipoproteins. Cytochrome b-6 was found to have a heme equivalent dry weight of 1 mol of heme per 60000 g. Of this, 20000 g was lipid-extractable. The molecular weight was 60000 with a partial specific volume of 0.84 ml/g.

A simple lipid composition (relative to the original membrane) was found consisting of 7 mol of chlorophyll a and 6 mol of cardiolipin per mol of cytochrome; these two lipids thus account for about 75-80% of the lipid content. An unidentified minor neutral lipid and minor polar lipid were also detected. At pH 7.0 in the presence of 0.5% Triton X-100, E'-o was -0.080 V, and in the absence of Triton X-100, E'-o was -0.120 V.

25002864,Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthesis in the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts is required for enhanced growth under sucrose supplementation.,"Plant galactolipid synthesis on the outer envelope membranes of chloroplasts is an important biosynthetic pathway for sustained growth under conditions of phosphate (Pi) depletion. During Pi starvation, the amount of digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) is increased to substitute for the phospholipids that are degraded for supplying Pi. An increase in DGDG concentration depends on an adequate supply of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), which is a substrate for DGDG synthesis and is synthesized by a type-B MGDG synthase, MGD3. Recently, sucrose was suggested to be a global regulator of plant responses to Pi starvation. Thus, we analyzed expression levels of several genes involved in lipid remodeling during Pi starvation in Arabidopsis thaliana and found that the abundance of MGD3 mRNA increased when sucrose was exogenously supplied to the growth medium. Sucrose supplementation retarded the growth of the Arabidopsis MGD3 knockout mutant mgd3 but enhanced the growth of transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing MGD3 compared with wild type, indicating the involvement of MGD3 in plant growth under sucrose-replete conditions. Although most features such as chlorophyll content, photosynthetic activity, and Pi content were comparable between wild-type and the transgenic plants overexpressing MGD3, sucrose content in shoot tissues decreased and incorporation of exogenously supplied carbon to DGDG was enhanced in the MGD3-overexpressing plants compared with wild type.

6653553,Freeze-fracture analysis of membrane appression and protein segregation in model membranes containing the chlorophyll-protein complexes from chloroplasts.,"Cation-induced membrane appression and lateral segregation of chlorophyll-protein complexes have been investigated by freeze-fracture analysis of model membranes containing photosystem 1 and the light-harvesting complex of photosystem 2. In light-harvesting complex proteoliposomes, cations caused extensive membrane adhesion and a segregation of protein into appressed regions. A marked flattening of the appressed membranes, sometimes together with a co-alignment of the particles on the opposing membrane faces, strongly suggests a direct transmembrane attraction between the protein particles. Photosystem 1 membranes were not appressed by cations but some clustering of the particles occurred, together with their exclusion from some regions of the lipid. By incorporating dipalmitoylglycerophosphocholine into the membranes, it is shown that a similar exclusion of the particles can occur due to liquid-crystalline to gel state transitions of the lipids. Proteoliposomes containing both the light-harvesting complex and photosystem 1 displayed cation-induced membrane appression, but only between regions containing the light-harvesting complex. Photosystem 1 was largely confined to unappressed membranes.

24249832,"A BAR-domain protein SH3P2, which binds to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and ATG8, regulates autophagosome formation in Arabidopsis.","Autophagy is a well-defined catabolic mechanism whereby cytoplasmic materials are engulfed into a structure termed the autophagosome. In plants, little is known about the underlying mechanism of autophagosome formation. In this study, we report that SH3 DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN2 (SH3P2), a Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs domain-containing protein, translocates to the phagophore assembly site/preautophagosome structure (PAS) upon autophagy induction and actively participates in the membrane deformation process. Using the SH3P2-green fluorescent protein fusion as a reporter, we found that the PAS develops from a cup-shaped isolation membranes or endoplasmic reticulum-derived omegasome-like structures. Using an inducible RNA interference (RNAi) approach, we show that RNAi knockdown of SH3P2 is developmentally lethal and significantly suppresses autophagosome formation. An in vitro membrane/lipid binding assay demonstrates that SH3P2 is a membrane-associated protein that binds to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate. SH3P2 may facilitate membrane expansion or maturation in coordination with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex during autophagy, as SH3P2 promotes PI3K foci formation, while PI3K inhibitor treatment inhibits SH3P2 from translocating to autophagosomes. Further interaction analysis shows that SH3P2 associates with the PI3K complex and interacts with ATG8s in Arabidopsis thaliana, whereby SH3P2 may mediate autophagy.

25954280,Loss of the Arabidopsis thaliana P4-ATPases ALA6 and ALA7 impairs pollen fitness and alters the pollen tube plasma membrane.,"Members of the P4 subfamily of P-type ATPases are thought to create and maintain lipid asymmetry in biological membranes by flipping specific lipids between membrane leaflets. In Arabidopsis, 7 of the 12 Aminophospholipid ATPase (ALA) family members are expressed in pollen. Here we show that double knockout of ALA6 and ALA7 (ala6/7) results in siliques with a ~2-fold reduction in seed set with a high frequency of empty seed positions near the bottom. Seed set was reduced to near zero when plants were grown under a hot/cold temperature stress. Reciprocal crosses indicate that the ala6/7 reproductive deficiencies are due to a defect related to pollen transmission. In-vitro growth assays provide evidence that ala6/7 pollen tubes are short and slow, with ~2-fold reductions in both maximal growth rate and overall length relative to wild-type. Outcrosses show that when ala6/7 pollen are in competition with wild-type pollen, they have a near 0% success rate in fertilizing ovules near the bottom of the pistil, consistent with ala6/7 pollen having short and slow growth defects. The ala6/7 phenotypes were rescued by the expression of either an ALA6-YFP or GFP-ALA6 fusion protein, which showed localization to both the plasma membrane and highly-mobile endomembrane structures. A mass spectrometry analysis of mature pollen grains revealed significant differences between ala6/7 and wild-type, both in the relative abundance of lipid classes and in the average number of double bonds present in acyl side chains. A change in the properties of the ala6/7 plasma membrane was also indicated by a ~10-fold reduction of labeling by lipophilic FM-dyes relative to wild-type.

Moreover, these non-phosphorous lipids are proposed to participate in low-phosphate (Pi) adaptations. Under Pi-limited conditions, a drastic accumulation of DGDG occurs concomitantly with a large reduction in membrane phospholipids, suggesting that plants substitute DGDG for phospholipids during Pi starvation. Previously, we reported that among the three MGDG synthase genes (MGD1, MGD2 and MGD3), the type-B MGD2 and MGD3 are upregulated in parallel with DGDG synthase genes during Pi starvation. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of T-DNA insertional mutants of Arabidopsis type-B MGD genes. Under Pi-starved conditions, the mgd3-1 mutant showed a drastic reduction in DGDG accumulation, particularly in the root, indicating that MGD3 is the main isoform responsible for DGDG biosynthesis in Pi-starved roots. Moreover, in the roots of mgd2 mgd3 plants, Pi stress-induced accumulation of DGDG was almost fully abolished, showing that type-B MGD enzymes are essential for membrane lipid remodeling in Pi-starved roots. Reductions in fresh weight, root growth and photosynthetic performance were also observed in these mutants under Pi-starved conditions. These results demonstrate that Pi stress-induced membrane lipid remodeling is important in plant growth during Pi starvation. The widespread distribution of type-B MGD genes in land plants suggests that membrane lipid remodeling mediated by type-B MGD enzymes is a potent adaptation to Pi deficiency for land plants.",10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03692.x,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""lipid remodeling"", ""galactolipid synthesis"", ""phosphate starvation adaptation""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Mono- and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG and DGDG, respectively) constitute the bulk of membrane lipids in plant chloroplasts."", ""Under Pi-limited conditions, a drastic accumulation of DGDG occurs concomitantly with a large reduction in membrane phospholipids, suggesting that plants substitute DGDG for phospholipids during Pi starvation.""], ""explanation"": ""The study examines how phosphate starvation induces changes in membrane lipid composition, focusing on galactolipid synthesis and remodeling of phospholipids, which directly involves fatty acid-containing lipids."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid remodeling"", ""galactolipid synthesis"", ""phosphate starvation adaptation""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",6: Membrane Lipid Remodeling,success,6.0,Membrane Lipid Remodeling
25477206,Specific role of phosphatidylglycerol and functional overlaps with other thylakoid lipids in Arabidopsis chloroplast biogenesis.,"With phosphate deficiency, the role of phosphatidylglycerol is compensated by increased glycolipid content in thylakoid membrane biogenesis but not photosynthetic electron transport in Arabidopsis chloroplasts. In plants and cyanobacteria, anionic phosphatidylglycerol (PG) is the only major phospholipid in thylakoid membranes, where neutral galactolipids monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) are predominant. In addition to provide a lipid bilayer matrix, PG plays a specific role in photosynthetic electron transport. Non-phosphorous sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG) is another anionic lipid in thylakoids; it substitutes for PG under phosphate (Pi) deficiency to maintain proper balance of anionic charge in thylakoid membranes. Although the crucial role of PG in photosynthesis has been deeply analyzed in cyanobacteria, its physiological function in seed plants other than photosynthesis remains unclear. To reveal specific roles of PG and functional overlaps with other thylakoid lipids, we characterized a PG-deficient Arabidopsis mutant (pgp1-2) under Pi-controlled conditions. Under Pi-sufficient conditions, the proportion of PG and other thylakoid lipids was decreased in pgp1-2, which led to severe disruption of thylakoid membrane biogenesis. Under Pi-deficient conditions, the proportion of all glycolipids in the mutant was greatly increased, with that of PG further decreased. In Pi-deficient pgp1-2, thylakoid membranes remarkably developed, which was accompanied by a change in nucleoid morphology and restored expression of nuclear- and plastid-encoded photosynthesis genes. Increase in glycolipid content with Pi deficiency may compensate for the loss of PG in terms of thylakoid membrane biogenesis. Although Pi deficiency increased chlorophyll and photosynthesis protein content in pgp1-2, it critically decreased photochemical activity in PSII. Further deprivation of PG in photosynthesis complexes may abolish the PSII activity in Pi-deficient pgp1-2, which suggests that glycolipids cannot replace PG in photosynthesis.",10.1007/s00299-014-1719-z,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis""]","[""phosphatidylglycerol"", ""glycolipids"", ""thylakoid membrane biogenesis"", ""photosynthetic electron transport""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""In plants and cyanobacteria, anionic phosphatidylglycerol (PG) is the only major phospholipid in thylakoid membranes, where neutral galactolipids monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) are predominant."", ""Non\u2011phosphorous sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG) is another anionic lipid in thylakoids; it substitutes for PG under phosphate (Pi) deficiency to maintain proper balance of anionic charge in thylakoid membranes.""], ""explanation"": ""The manuscript examines the composition, abundance, and functional roles of specific thylakoid lipids\u2014particularly phosphatidylglycerol and glycolipids\u2014in Arabidopsis chloroplasts, directly addressing lipid metabolism and membrane biogenesis."", ""specific_topics"": [""phosphatidylglycerol"", ""glycolipids"", ""thylakoid membrane biogenesis"", ""photosynthetic electron transport""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",6: Membrane Lipid Remodeling,success,6.0,Membrane Lipid Remodeling
17442261,Changes in photosynthetic electron transfer and state transitions in an herbicide-resistant D1 mutant from soybean cell cultures.,"Anomalies in photosynthetic activity of the soybean cell line STR7, carrying a single mutation (S268P) in the chloroplastic gene psbA that codes for the D1 protein of the photosystem II, have been examined using different spectroscopic techniques. Thermoluminescence emission experiments have shown important differences between STR7 mutant and wild type cells. The afterglow band induced by both white light flashes and far-red continuous illumination was downshifted by about 4 degrees C and the Q band was upshifted by 5 degrees C. High temperature thermoluminescence measurements suggested a higher level of lipid peroxidation in mutant thylakoid membranes. In addition, the reduction rate of P700(+) was significantly accelerated in STR7 suggesting that the mutation led to an activation of the photosystem I cyclic electron flow. Modulated fluorescence measurements performed at room temperature as well as fluorescence emission spectra at 77 K revealed that the STR7 mutant is defective in state transitions. Here, we discuss the hypothesis that activation of the cyclic electron flow in STR7 cells may be a mechanism to compensate the reduced activity of photosystem II caused by the mutation. We also propose that the impaired state transitions in the STR7 cells may be due to alterations in thylakoid membrane properties induced by a low content of unsaturated lipids.",10.1016/j.bbabio.2007.02.017,True,high,True,high,"[""soybean""]","[""lipid peroxidation"", ""unsaturated lipids""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""soybean""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""High temperature thermoluminescence measurements suggested a higher level of lipid peroxidation in mutant thylakoid membranes."", ""The impaired state transitions in the STR7 cells may be due to alterations in thylakoid membrane properties induced by a low content of unsaturated lipids.""], ""explanation"": ""The study discusses increased lipid peroxidation and changes in unsaturated lipid content affecting thylakoid membrane properties, indicating direct investigation of lipid-related processes."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid peroxidation"", ""unsaturated lipids""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",6: Membrane Lipid Remodeling,success,6.0,Membrane Lipid Remodeling
1191660,Photophosphorylation and related properties of reaggregated vesicles from spinach photosystem I particles.,"The small Photosystem I particles prepared from spinach chloroplasts by the action of Triton X-100 (TSF 1 particles) reaggregate into membrane structures when they are incubated with soybean phospholipids and cholate and then subjected to a slow dialysis. The membranes so formed are vesicular in nature and show the capability of catalyzing phenazine methosulfate-mediated cyclic photophosphorylation at rates which are usually about 20% of those observed with chloroplasts, but higher rates have been obtained. When coupling factor is removed from the chloroplasts by treatment with EDTA, a requirement for coupling factor can be shown for the subsequent ATP formation. The uncouplers carbonylcyanide 3-chlorophenyl-hydrazone, valinomycin, Triton X-100 and NH+4 are effective with the reformed vesicles, which do not show the typical light-induced pH gradient observed with chloroplasts. Incubation of the TSF 1 particles with phospholipids alone allows for the formation of membrane vesicles, but such vesicles are only slightly active in ATP formation. In most properties investigated, the reformed membrane vesicles resemble the original chloroplast membrane so far as phenazine methosulfate-mediated cyclic photophosphorylation is concerned, which indicates a high degree of selectivity in the reaggregation process.

When maize microsomes were incubated with [3H]inositol without any exogenous CPM-PA, the most heavily labelled molecular species were 16:0/18:2-PI (77%), 16:0/18:3-plus 18:2/18:2-PI (15%), 16:0/18:1-PI (4%) and 18:0/18:2-PI (4%). Addition to the incubation medium of up to 300 microM 16:0/16:0-CMP-PA unexpectedly resulted in the formation of very little labelled 16:0/16:0-PI. When the solubilized fraction from microsomes was incubated with [3H]inositol in absence of 16:0/16:0-CPM-PA, the same PI molecular species as above were synthesized. However, with increasing concentrations of 16:0/16:0-CMP-PA in the medium, increasing amounts of labelled 16:0/16:0-PI appeared as well. With prepurified PI-synthase eluted from a DEAE column, endogenous CMP-PA was poorly utilized for PI biosynthesis whereas the exogenous 16:0/16:0-CPM-PA was used actively. With time, the endogenous CMP-PA was utilized first and the exogenous substrate was utilized, albeit, much more slowly. The results demonstrate that the selectivity displayed by PI-synthase towards various molecular species of CMP-PA depends on the integration of the enzyme in the membrane structure.

11696551,"DGD2, an arabidopsis gene encoding a UDP-galactose-dependent digalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase is expressed during growth under phosphate-limiting conditions.","The galactolipid digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), one of the main chloroplast lipids in higher plants, is believed to be synthesized by the galactolipid:galactolipid galactosyltransferase, which transfers a galactose moiety from one molecule of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) to another. Here, we report that Arabidopsis as well as other plant species contain two genes, DGD1 and DGD2, encoding enzymes with DGDG synthase activity. Using MGDG and UDP-galactose as substrates for in vitro assays with DGD2 we could for the first time measure DGDG synthase activity of a heterologously expressed plant cDNA. UDP-galactose, but not MGDG, serves as the galactose donor for DGDG synthesis catalyzed by DGD2, providing clear evidence for the existence of a UDP-galactose-dependent DGDG synthase in higher plants. In in vitro assays, DGD2 was capable of galactosylating DGDG, resulting in the synthesis of an oligogalactolipid tentatively identified as trigalactosyldiacylglycerol. DGD2 mRNA expression in leaves was very low but was strongly induced during growth under phosphate-limiting conditions. This induction correlates with the previously described increase in DGDG during phosphate deprivation.

These treatments reduced shoot growth and changed the lipid composition of the shoot plasma membranes. In oat, both tetcyclacis and nuarimol treatments increased plasma membrane cholesterol and increased the phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylcholine (PE/PC) ratio, whereas gamma-ketotriazole treatment reduced cholesterol and the PE/PC ratio. In rye, all treatments reduced the PE/PC ratio. Generally, the sterol/phospholipid ratio was less in oat than in rye but the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio was greater. With all treatments in oat and rye, increases were observed in unsaturation of the phospholipid acyl chains. The fluidity of membranes was measured by steady-state fluorescence polarisation of the probe diphenylhexatriene; oat membranes were more fluid than rye. Membrane fluidity was greater in plasma membranes from plants treated with the xenobiotics than the controls.

RT-PCR confirmed a marked increase in FAD7 expression, in young Nicotiana tabacum (cv. Havana) plants harboring cor15a-FAD7, after a short-term exposure to cold. When young, cold-induced tobacco seedlings were exposed to low-temperature (0.5, 2 or 3.5 degrees C) for up to 44 days, survival within independent cor15a-FAD7 transgenic lines (40.2-96%) was far superior to the wild type (6.7-10.2%). In addition, the major trienoic fatty acid species remained stable in cold-induced cor15a-FAD7 N. tabacum plants under prolonged cold storage while the levels of hexadecatrienoic acid (16:3) and octadecatrienoic acid (18:3) declined in wild type plants under the same conditions (79 and 20.7% respectively). Electron microscopy showed that chloroplast membrane ultrastructure in cor15a-FAD7 transgenic plants was unaffected by prolonged exposure to cold temperatures. In contrast, wild type plants experienced a loss of granal stacking and disorganization of the thylakoid membrane under the same conditions. Changes in membrane integrity coincided with a precipitous decline in leaf chlorophyll concentration and low survival rates in wild type plants. Cold-induced double transgenic N. alata (cv.

22691045,Opportunities for improving phosphorus-use efficiency in crop plants.,"Limitation of grain crop productivity by phosphorus (P) is widespread and will probably increase in the future. Enhanced P efficiency can be achieved by improved uptake of phosphate from soil (P-acquisition efficiency) and by improved productivity per unit P taken up (P-use efficiency). This review focuses on improved P-use efficiency, which can be achieved by plants that have overall lower P concentrations, and by optimal distribution and redistribution of P in the plant allowing maximum growth and biomass allocation to harvestable plant parts. Significant decreases in plant P pools may be possible, for example, through reductions of superfluous ribosomal RNA and replacement of phospholipids by sulfolipids and galactolipids. Improvements in P distribution within the plant may be possible by increased remobilization from tissues that no longer need it (e.g. senescing leaves) and reduced partitioning of P to developing grains. Such changes would prolong and enhance the productive use of P in photosynthesis and have nutritional and environmental benefits.

638142,The effects of cotyledon senescence on the composition and physical properties of membrane lipid.,"The phospholipid content of rough and smooth microsomal fractions from cotyledons of germinating bean declines as the tissue becomes senescent. Both types of membrane contain comparable proportions of three major phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol, which collectively comprise about 90% of the total. This proportionality does not change appreciably during senescence. Only small quantities of lysophosphatides were noted at all stages of senescence. The unsaturated:saturated fatty acid ratio for total extracted lipid declined only slightly in both membrane systems, but pronounced differences in this ratio were observed among the major phospholipids of the membranes. The most striking alteration in lipid composition with advancing senescence was an increase in the sterol:phospholipid ratio; this rose by about 50% for rough microsomes and 400% for smooth microsomes. For both types of membrane the patterns of change in this ratio correlated with previously reported changes in bulk lipid transition temperature, suggesting that the increase in sterol level may contribute to changes in phase behaviour of the membranes during senescence. Arrhenius plots of rotational correlation times for the electron spin label 2,2-dimethyl-5-dodecyl-5-methyloxazolidine-N-oxide (2N14) partitioned into the membrane lipid showed an increase in viscosity with advancing senescence and a corresponding increase in activation energy for both types of membrane. These changes in activation energy and viscosity correlated closely with the increase in sterol:phospholipid ratio. However, no phase transitions were detectable between temperatures of 2 and 55 degrees C despite the fact that transitions from a lipid-crystalline to gel state are detectable within this temperature range by wide angle X-ray diffraction.",10.1016/0005-2736(78)90325-5,True,high,True,high,"[""Phaseolus vulgaris""]","[""membrane lipid composition"", ""sterol\u2011phospholipid ratio"", ""fatty acid saturation ratio""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Phaseolus vulgaris""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""The phospholipid content of rough and smooth microsomal fractions from cotyledons of germinating bean declines as the tissue becomes senescent."", ""The unsaturated:saturated fatty acid ratio for total extracted lipid declined only slightly in both membrane systems, but pronounced differences in this ratio were observed among the major phospholipids of the membranes.""], ""explanation"": ""The study examines how membrane lipid composition, including phospholipids, fatty acid saturation ratios, and sterol levels, changes during cotyledon senescence, directly addressing lipid biochemistry."", ""specific_topics"": [""membrane lipid composition"", ""sterol\u2011phospholipid ratio"", ""fatty acid saturation ratio""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",6: Membrane Lipid Remodeling,success,6.0,Membrane Lipid Remodeling
21896643,Very-long-chain fatty acids are required for cell plate formation during cytokinesis in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"Acyl chain length is thought to be crucial for biophysical properties of the membrane, in particular during cell division, when active vesicular fusion is necessary. In higher plants, the process of cytokinesis is unique, because the separation of the two daughter cells is carried out by de novo vesicular fusion to generate a laterally expanding cell plate. In Arabidopsis thaliana, very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) depletion caused by a mutation in the microsomal elongase gene PASTICCINO2 (PAS2) or by application of the selective elongase inhibitor flufenacet altered cytokinesis. Cell plate expansion was delayed and the formation of the endomembrane tubular network altered. These defects were associated with specific aggregation of the cell plate markers YFP-Rab-A2a and KNOLLE during cytokinesis. Changes in levels of VLCFA also resulted in modification of endocytosis and sensitivity to brefeldin A. Finally, the cytokinesis impairment in pas2 cells was associated with reduced levels of very long fatty acyl chains in phospholipids.

16666863,Enhanced thermal tolerance of photosynthesis and altered chloroplast ultrastructure in a mutant of Arabidopsis deficient in lipid desaturation.,"A mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, deficient in activity of the chloroplast n-6 desaturase, accumulated high levels of C(16:1) and C(18:1) lipids and had correspondingly reduced levels of polyunsaturated lipids. The altered lipid composition of the mutant had pronounced effects on chloroplast ultrastructure, thylakoid membrane protein and chlorophyll content, electron transport rates, and the thermal stability of the photosynthetic membranes. The change in chloroplast ultrastructure was due to a 48% decrease in the amount of appressed membranes that was not compensated for by an increased amount of nonappressed membrane. This resulted in a net loss of 36% of the thylakoid membrane per chloroplast and a corresponding reduction in chlorophyll and protein content. Electrophoretic analysis of the chlorophyll-protein complexes further revealed a small decrease in the amount of light-harvesting complex. Relative levels of whole chain and protosystem II electron transport rates were also reduced in the mutant. In addition, the mutation resulted in enhanced thermal stability of photosynthetic electron transport.

The morphology of the aggregates of their phospholipid substrate fundamentally defines the interaction between the enzyme and the surface. Here we demonstrate that the Ca(2+)-induced generation of membrane microdomains dramatically activates alpha-type phospholipase D from white cabbage. 500-fold stimulation was observed upon incorporation of 10 mol % 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (POPA) into 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) vesicles in the presence of Ca(2+) ions. Enhanced association of PLDalpha2 with phospholipid surfaces containing anionic components was indicated by lag phase analysis and film balance measurements. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that the POPA-specific activation correlates with the phase behavior of the POPC/POPA vesicles in the presence of Ca(2+) ions. We conclude from the results that the Ca(2+)-induced formation of POPA microdomains is the crucial parameter that facilitates the binding of PLD to the phospholipid surface and suggest that this effect serves as a cellular switch for controlling PLD activity.",10.1002/cbic.200800431,True,high,True,high,"[""white cabbage""]","[""phospholipase D activity"", ""membrane microdomains"", ""lipid substrate"", ""Ca2+-dependent activation""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""white cabbage""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Plant alpha-type phospholipase D proteins are calcium-dependent, lipolytic enzymes."", ""Here we demonstrate that the Ca(2+)-induced generation of membrane microdomains dramatically activates alpha-type phospholipase D from white cabbage.""], ""explanation"": ""The study focuses on phospholipase D, a key lipid\u2011hydrolyzing enzyme, and examines how calcium\u2011induced membrane microdomains influence its activity, directly addressing lipid metabolism and signaling processes."", ""specific_topics"": [""phospholipase D activity"", ""membrane microdomains"", ""lipid substrate"", ""Ca2+-dependent activation""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",6: Membrane Lipid Remodeling,success,6.0,Membrane Lipid Remodeling
19106119,Alterations in detergent-resistant plasma membrane microdomains in Arabidopsis thaliana during cold acclimation.,"Microdomains in the plasma membrane (PM) have been proposed to be involved in many important cellular events in plant cells. To understand the role of PM microdomains in plant cold acclimation, we isolated the microdomains as detergent-resistant plasma membrane fractions (DRMs) from Arabidopsis seedlings and compared lipid and protein compositions before and after cold acclimation. The DRM was enriched in sterols and glucocerebrosides, and the proportion of free sterols in the DRM increased after cold acclimation. The protein-to-lipid ratio in the DRM was greater than that in the total PM fraction. The protein amount recovered in DRMs decreased gradually during cold acclimation. Cold acclimation further resulted in quantitative changes in DRM protein profiles. Subsequent mass spectrometry and Western blot analyses revealed that P-type H(+)-ATPases, aquaporins and endocytosis-related proteins increased and, conversely, tubulins, actins and V-type H(+)-ATPase subunits decreased in DRMs during cold acclimation. Functional categorization of cold-responsive proteins in DRMs suggests that plant PM microdomains function as platforms of membrane transport, membrane trafficking and cytoskeleton interaction. These comprehensive changes in microdomains may be associated with cold acclimation of Arabidopsis.",10.1093/pcp/pcn202,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""lipid composition"", ""sterol enrichment"", ""protein\u2011to\u2011lipid ratio""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""To understand the role of PM microdomains in plant cold acclimation, we isolated the microdomains as detergent-resistant plasma membrane fractions (DRMs) from Arabidopsis seedlings and compared lipid and protein compositions before and after cold acclimation."", ""The DRM was enriched in sterols and glucocerebrosides, and the proportion of free sterols in the DRM increased after cold acclimation.""], ""explanation"": ""The study examines how lipid components\u2014specifically sterols and glucocerebrosides\u2014in detergent\u2011resistant plasma membrane microdomains change during cold acclimation in Arabidopsis, including measurements of protein\u2011to\u2011lipid ratios."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid composition"", ""sterol enrichment"", ""protein\u2011to\u2011lipid ratio""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",6: Membrane Lipid Remodeling,success,6.0,Membrane Lipid Remodeling

Membrane composition and integrity are becoming the focus of studies aiming to understand how plants adapt to its environment. In this study, using a combination of di-4-ANEPPDHQ fluorescence and spectral phasor analysis, we report that the drought hypersensitive/squalene epoxidase (dry2/sqe1-5) mutant with reduced major sterols such as sitosterol and stigmasterol in roots presented higher membrane fluidity than the wild type.

27179363,Molecular species composition of plant cardiolipin determined by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.,"Cardiolipin (CL), an anionic phospholipid of the inner mitochondrial membrane, provides essential functions for stabilizing respiratory complexes and is involved in mitochondrial morphogenesis and programmed cell death in animals. The role of CL and its metabolism in plants are less well understood. The measurement of CL in plants, including its molecular species composition, is hampered by the fact that CL is of extremely low abundance, and that plants contain large amounts of interfering compounds including galactolipids, neutral lipids, and pigments. We used solid phase extraction by anion exchange chromatography to purify CL from crude plant lipid extracts. LC/MS was used to determine the content and molecular species composition of CL. Thus, up to 23 different molecular species of CL were detected in different plant species, including Arabidopsis, mung bean, spinach, barley, and tobacco. Similar to animals, plant CL is dominated by highly unsaturated species, mostly containing linoleic and linolenic acid. During phosphate deprivation or exposure to an extended dark period, the amount of CL decreased in Arabidopsis, accompanied with an increased degree in unsaturation.

1600084,Calorimetric and x-ray diffraction studies of rye glucocerebroside mesomorphism.,"Glucocerebrosides (GlcCer) isolated from the leaves of winter rye (Secale cereale L. cv Puma) differ from the more commonly investigated natural and synthetic cerebrosides, in that greater than 95% of the fatty acids are saturated and monounsaturated hydroxy fatty acids. Isomers of the trihydroxy long chain base hydroxysphingenine (t1(8:18 cis or trans)) and isomers of sphingadienine (d18:2(4trans, 8 cis or trans)) comprise 77% and 17%, respectively, of the total long chain bases. The phase behavior of fully hydrated and dry rye leaf GlcCer was investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and x-ray diffraction. On initial heating, aqueous dispersions of GlcCer exhibit a single endothermic transition at 56 degrees C and have an enthalpy (delta H) of 46 J/g. Cooling to 0 degrees C is accompanied by a small exothermic transition (delta H = -8 J/g) at 8 degrees C. On immediate reheating, a broad exothermic transition (delta H = -39 J/g) is observed between 10 and 20 degrees C in addition to a transition at 56 degrees C. These transitions are not reversible, and the exothermic transition rapidly diminishes when the sample is held at low temperature. Using x-ray diffraction, it was determined that the endotherm at 56 degrees C represents a transition from a highly ordered lamellar crystalline phase (Lc) with a d-spacing of 57 A and a series of wide-angle reflections in the 3-10 A range, to a lamellar liquid crystalline (L alpha) phase having a d-spacing of 55 A and a diffuse wide-angle scattering peak centered at 4.7 A. Cooling leads to the formation of a metastable gel phase (L beta) with a d-spacing of 64.0 A and a single broad reflection at 4.28 A. Subsequent warming to above 15 degrees C restores the original Lc phase. Thus, rye GlcCer in excess water exhibit a series of irreversible transitions and gel phase metastability. Dry GlcCer undergo an initial heating endothermic transition at 130 degrees C, which is ascribed to a transformation into the HII phase from a two phase state characterized by the coexistence of phases with disordered (alpha) and helical (delta) type chain conformations but of unknown lattice identity: An exotherm at 67.5 degrees C observed upon subsequent cooling is of unknown origin. Since an undercooled HII phase persists down to 19 degrees C, the exotherm may derive in part from an alpha-to-delta type chain packing conformational change especially under slow cooling conditions. Upon reheating from low temperatures to 65 degrees C, a phase with a two-dimensional, primitive rectangular lattice and delta-like chain packing (R8 phase) in coexistence with the HI, phase emerges. With continued heating to 90 degrees C these coexisting phases give way to a phase with a two-dimensional, centered rectangular lattice and delta-like chain packing (P8phase) which again coexists with the HI, phase. Above 130 degrees C, the Pb phase disappears and the sample converts completely to the HI, phase as observed upon initial heating. These results indicate that the mesomorphic behavior of rye leaf GIcCer is distinct from that of other cerebrosides.",10.1016/S0006-3495(92)81937-9,True,high,True,high,"[""Secale cereale""]","[""fatty acid composition"", ""lipid phase behavior"", ""membrane biophysics""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Secale cereale""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Glucocerebrosides (GlcCer) isolated from the leaves of winter rye (Secale cereale L. cv Puma) differ from the more commonly investigated natural and synthetic cerebrosides, in that greater than 95% of the fatty acids are saturated and monounsaturated hydroxy fatty acids."", ""The phase behavior of fully hydrated and dry rye leaf GlcCer was investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and x-ray diffraction.""], ""explanation"": ""The study characterizes the fatty acid composition of glucocerebrosides extracted from rye leaves and examines their thermotropic phase transitions using calorimetry and X\u2011ray diffraction, both central techniques in lipid research."", ""specific_topics"": [""fatty acid composition"", ""lipid phase behavior"", ""membrane biophysics""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",6: Membrane Lipid Remodeling,success,6.0,Membrane Lipid Remodeling
15628845,Structure of beta-purothionin in membranes: a two-dimensional infrared correlation spectroscopy study.,"Two-dimensional infrared correlation spectroscopy has been used to investigate the structure of beta-purothionin, a small basic protein found in the endosperm of wheat seeds, in the absence and presence of dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) membranes. To generate the two-dimensional synchronous and asynchronous maps, hydrogen-deuterium exchange of the protein amide protons has been used as an external perturbation. This method has allowed us to separate the different secondary structure elements and side chain contributions in the regions of amide I, II, and II' bands to determine that the relative order of deuteration of the beta-purothionin protons is as follows: turns, asparagines, and lysines > unordered structure and tyrosine > beta-sheet > alpha-helices and arginines. The results also indicate that the protein undergoes significant changes both in secondary structure and in deuteration in the presence of DMPG bilayers. The helical content of beta-purothionin is higher in the presence of the lipid, and the relative order of deuteration is as follows: lysines and arginines > asparagines and beta-sheet > unordered structure and alpha-helices. The inversion in the deuteration order of the arginine residues is assigned to a change of the degree of association of the protein in the membrane. In addition, the results reveal that the part of the protein containing the tyrosine residue interacts with the lipid membrane.

27047516,Multiple Impacts of Loss of Plastidic Phosphatidylglycerol Biosynthesis on Photosynthesis during Seedling Growth of Arabidopsis.,"Phosphatidylglycerol (PG) is the only major phospholipid in the thylakoid membrane in cyanobacteria and plant chloroplasts. Although PG accounts only for ~10% of total thylakoid lipids, it plays indispensable roles in oxygenic photosynthesis. In contrast to the comprehensive analyses of PG-deprived mutants in cyanobacteria, in vivo roles of PG in photosynthesis during plant growth remain elusive. In this study, we characterized the photosynthesis of an Arabidopsis thaliana T-DNA insertional mutant (pgp1-2), which lacks plastidic PG biosynthesis. In the pgp1-2 mutant, energy transfer from antenna pigments to the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center was severely impaired, which resulted in low photochemical efficiency of PSII. Unlike in the wild type, in pgp1-2, the PSII complexes were susceptible to photodamage by red light irradiation. Manganese ions were mostly dissociated from protein systems in pgp1-2, with oxygen-evolving activity of PSII absent in the mutant thylakoids. The oxygen-evolving complex may be disrupted in pgp1-2, which may accelerate the photodamage to PSII by red light. On the acceptor side of the mutant PSII, decreased electron-accepting capacity was observed along with impaired electron transfer. Although the reaction center of PSI was relatively active in pgp1-2 compared to the severe impairment in PSII, the cyclic electron transport was dysfunctional. Chlorophyll fluorescence analysis at 77K revealed that PG may not be needed for the self-organization of the macromolecular protein network in grana thylakoids but is essential for the assembly of antenna-reaction center complexes.

24753539,A Shoot-Specific Hypoxic Response of Arabidopsis Sheds Light on the Role of the Phosphate-Responsive Transcription Factor PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1.,"Plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses are often very specific, but signal transduction pathways can partially or completely overlap. Here, we demonstrate that in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the transcriptional responses to phosphate starvation and oxygen deficiency stress comprise a set of commonly induced genes. While the phosphate deficiency response is systemic, under oxygen deficiency, most of the commonly induced genes are found only in illuminated shoots. This jointly induced response to the two stresses is under control of the transcription factor PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1 (PHR1), but not of the oxygen-sensing N-end rule pathway, and includes genes encoding proteins for the synthesis of galactolipids, which replace phospholipids in plant membranes under phosphate starvation. Despite the induction of galactolipid synthesis genes, total galactolipid content and plant survival are not severely affected by the up-regulation of galactolipid gene expression in illuminated leaves during hypoxia. However, changes in galactolipid molecular species composition point to an adaptation of lipid fluxes through the endoplasmic reticulum and chloroplast pathways during hypoxia. PHR1-mediated signaling of phosphate deprivation was also light dependent. Because a photoreceptor-mediated PHR1 activation was not detectable under hypoxia, our data suggest that a chloroplast-derived retrograde signal, potentially arising from metabolic changes, regulates PHR1 activity under both oxygen and phosphate deficiency.",10.1104/pp.114.237990,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""galactolipid synthesis"", ""lipid flux adaptation""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""genes encoding proteins for the synthesis of galactolipids, which replace phospholipids in plant membranes under phosphate starvation."", ""changes in galactolipid molecular species composition point to an adaptation of lipid fluxes through the endoplasmic reticulum and chloroplast pathways during hypoxia.""], ""explanation"": ""The study examines how phosphate starvation and hypoxia affect the synthesis and composition of galactolipids, key neutral lipids involved in membrane remodeling, indicating direct investigation into lipid metabolism and its regulation under stress conditions."", ""specific_topics"": [""galactolipid synthesis"", ""lipid flux adaptation""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",6: Membrane Lipid Remodeling,success,6.0,Membrane Lipid Remodeling
8018707,Structural characteristics of thylakoid membranes of Arabidopsis mutants deficient in lipid fatty acid desaturation.,"The ultrastructure of thylakoid membranes from Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type, JB67 and LK3 fatty acid desaturation deficient mutants was studied by thin-section and freeze-fracture electron microscopy. There was a decrease in the amount of the appressed and non-appressed membranes in JB67 and LK3 Arbidopsis mutants when compared to the wild type, resulting in a reduction in the length of photosynthetic membrane per plastid. The results from freeze-fracture showed a decrease in size and a marked increase in packing density of membrane-associated particles on the exo- and endoplasmic fracture faces of the mutants.

The linoleoyl lipids are common in plants and the main component of the soybean membrane. The lipid composition of soybean plasma membranes has been thoroughly characterized with experimental studies. However, there is comparatively less work done with computational modeling. Our molecular dynamics (MD) simulation results show that the pure linoleoyl lipids, 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (18:0/18:2) and 1,2-dilinoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (di-18:2), agree very well with the experiments, which demonstrates the accuracy of the C36FF for the computational study of soybean membranes. Based on the experimental composition, the soybean hypocotyl and root plasma membrane models are developed with each containing seven or eight types of linoleoyl phospholipids and two types of sterols (sitosterol and stigmasterol). MD simulations are performed to characterize soybean membranes, and the hydrogen bonds and clustering results demonstrate that the lipids prefer to interact with the lipids of the same/similar tail unsaturation.

Biophysical characteristics of model lipid and isolated animal membranes with altered sterol component have been intensively studied. In plants however, the precise mechanisms of involvement of sterols in membrane functioning remain unclear. In present work the possible interactions between sterols and other membrane lipids in plant cells were studied. A useful experimental approach for elucidating the roles of sterols in membrane activity is to use agents that specifically bind with endogenous sterols, for example the antibiotic nystatin. Membrane characteristics and the composition of membrane lipids in the roots of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seedlings treated with nystatin were analyzed. The application of nystatin greatly increased the permeability of the plasma membrane for ions and SH-containing molecules and decreased the total sterol level mainly as a consequence of a reduction in the amount of β-sitosterol and campesterol. Dynamic light-scattering was used to confirm the in vitro formation of stable complexes between nystatin and β-sitosterol or cholesterol. Sterol depletion was accompanied by a significant rise in total glycoceramide (GlCer) content after 2h treatment with nystatin.

It has been reported that CaHSP26 is a member of the CPsHSP gene family related to extreme temperature tolerance in plants. In the present work, the transcripts were detected in the transgenic tobacco lines. The actual quantum yield of photosynthesis (ΦPSII), non-photochemical quenching, and stomatal conductance (gs) in the transgenic lines overexpressing CaHSP26 were higher than those in the wild-type plants under a range of photosynthetic photon flux density during chilling stress. Electron microscopic analysis showed that the transgenic line (L1) had larger size of stomata to lessen stomatal limitation. The activities of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) were also higher in the transgenic lines than those in wild-type plants. Additionally, a significant increase in cis-unsaturated fatty acid contents was observed in transgenic lines due to lower temperatures. These results suggested that CaHSP26 protein plays an important role in protection of PSII by maintaining the antioxidative enzyme activities to avoid or mitigate photooxidation and increasing the fluidity of the thylakoid membrane during chilling stress under low irradiance.

15618420,Analysis of detergent-resistant membranes in Arabidopsis. Evidence for plasma membrane lipid rafts.,"The trafficking and function of cell surface proteins in eukaryotic cells may require association with detergent-resistant sphingolipid- and sterol-rich membrane domains. The aim of this work was to obtain evidence for lipid domain phenomena in plant membranes. A protocol to prepare Triton X-100 detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) was developed using Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) callus membranes. A comparative proteomics approach using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry revealed that the DRMs were highly enriched in specific proteins. They included eight glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, several plasma membrane (PM) ATPases, multidrug resistance proteins, and proteins of the stomatin/prohibitin/hypersensitive response family, suggesting that the DRMs originated from PM domains. We also identified a plant homolog of flotillin, a major mammalian DRM protein, suggesting a conserved role for this protein in lipid domain phenomena in eukaryotic cells. Lipid analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showed that the DRMs had a 4-fold higher sterol-to-protein content than the average for Arabidopsis membranes. The DRMs were also 5-fold increased in sphingolipid-to-protein ratio. Our results indicate that the preparation of DRMs can yield a very specific set of membrane proteins and suggest that the PM contains phytosterol and sphingolipid-rich lipid domains with a specialized protein composition. Our results also suggest a conserved role of lipid modification in targeting proteins to both the intracellular and extracellular leaflet of these domains.

The interaction with anionic DPPG monolayers, monitored by surface pressure isotherms, was influenced significantly by mutations in Pin-b (p < 0.05); wild-type Pin-b showed the highest surface pressure change of 10.6 +/- 1.0 mN m-1, followed by Pin-bH (7.9 +/- 1.6 mN m-1) and Pin-bS (6.3 +/- 1.0 mN m-1), and the surface pressure isotherm kinetics were also different in each case. Integrated Amide I peak areas from corresponding ER-FTIR spectra confirmed the differences in adsorption kinetics, but also showed that differences in adsorbed amount were less significant, suggesting that mutations influence the degree of penetration into DPPG films. All Pin-b types showed evidence of interaction with DPPC films, detected as changes in surface pressure (5.6 +/- 1.1 mN m-1); however, no protein peaks were detected in the ER-FTIR spectra, which indicated that the interaction was via penetration with limited adsorption at the lipid/water interface. The expression of Pin-b mutants is linked to wheat endosperm hardness; therefore, the data presented here suggest that the lipid binding properties may be pivotal within the mechanism for this quality trait.

Genetic complementation, reciprocal crossing and microscope observation of npc2-1/- npc6-2/+ and npc2-1/+ npc6-2/- plants suggest that NPC2 and NPC6 are redundant and are required for normal gametophyte development. Both NPC2 and NPC6 proteins are localized to the plastids. Promoter-GUS assays in transgenic Arabidopsis revealed that NPC2 and NPC6 are preferentially expressed in floral organs rather than in leaves. In vitro enzyme assays showed that NPC2 and NPC6 hydrolyze phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, but not phosphatidate, being consistent with the reported substrate selectivity of NPCs. The amounts of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol were increased in buds but not in flowers of npc2-1/- npc6-2/+ and npc2-1/+ npc6-2/- plants, presumably due to reduced phospholipid hydrolysis activity in developing flowers.

12514242,Phosphatidylglycerol is essential for the development of thylakoid membranes in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"Phosphatidylglycerol is a ubiquitous phospholipid in the biological membranes of many organisms. In plants, phosphatidylglycerol is mainly present in thylakoid membranes and has been suggested to play specific roles in photosynthesis. Here, we have isolated two T-DNA tagged lines of Arabidopsis thaliana that have a T-DNA insertion in the PGP1 gene encoding a phosphatidylglycerolphosphate synthase involved in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylglycerol. In homozygous plants of the T-DNA tagged lines, the PGP1 gene was completely disrupted. The growth of these knockout mutants was dependent on the presence of sucrose in the growth medium, and these plants had pale yellow-green leaves. The leaves of the mutants had remarkably large intercellular spaces due to the reduction in the number of mesophyll cells. The development of chloroplasts in the leaf cells was severely arrested in the mutants. Mesophyll cells with chloroplast particles are only found around vascular structures, whereas epidermal cells are enlarged but largely conserved. The content of phosphatidylglycerol in the mutants was reduced to 12% of that of the wild type.

In one possible scenario, molecular interactions in sterol-rich PM microdomains or another form of sterol-dependent membrane scaffolding may be critical for maintaining the correct subcellular localization, structural integrity and/or activity of the cellulose synthase machinery. Another possible link may be through steryl glucosides, which could act as primers for the attachment of glucose monomers during the synthesis of β-(1 → 4) glucan chains that form the cellulose microfibrils.

12230579,"Kinetics of violaxanthin de-epoxidation by violaxanthin de-epoxidase, a xanthophyll cycle enzyme, is regulated by membrane fluidity in model lipid bilayers.",This paper describes violaxanthin de-epoxidation in model lipid bilayers. Unilamellar egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) vesicles supplemented with monogalactosyldiacylglycerol were found to be a suitable system for studying this reaction. Such a system resembles more the native thylakoid membrane and offers better possibilities for studying kinetics and factors controlling de-epoxidation of violaxanthin than a system composed only ofmonogalactosyldiacylglycerol and is commonly used in xanthophyll cycle studies. The activity of violaxanthin de-epoxidase (VDE) strongly depended on the ratio of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol to PtdCho in liposomes. The mathematical model of violaxanthin de-epoxidation was applied to calculate the probability of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin conversion at different phases of de-epoxidation reactions. Measurements of deepoxidation rate and EPR-spin label study at different temperatures revealed that dynamic properties of the membrane are important factors that might control conversion of violaxanthin to antheraxanthin. A model of the molecular mechanism of violaxanthin de-epoxidation where the reversed hexagonal structures (mainly created by monogalactosyldiacylglycerol) are assumed to be required for violaxanthin conversion to zeaxanthin is proposed. The presence of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol reversed hexagonal phase was detected in the PtdCho/monogalactosyldiacylglycerol liposomes membrane by 31P-NMR studies. The availability of violaxanthin for de-epoxidation is a diffusion-dependent process controlled by membrane fluidity.

6742852,The role of lysophosphatidylcholine in lipid synthesis by developing sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) seed microsomes.,"The incorporation of oleate from oleoyl-CoA into lipids by microsomes from developing sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) seeds has been investigated. Oleate was incorporated mainly into position 2 of phosphatidylcholine or released as free fatty acid. The addition of exogenous 1-acyl-lysophosphatidylcholine increased the incorporation of oleate into position 2 of phosphatidylcholine and decreased the release of free oleate. In the absence of exogenous lysophosphatidylcholine, the incorporation of oleate into phosphatidylcholine was limited by the amount of endogenous acceptor present. DH-990, an inhibitor of acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase, almost completely inhibited the incorporation of oleate from oleoyl-CoA into phosphatidylcholine at a concentration of 2.5 mM. These results indicate that the incorporation of oleate from oleoyl-CoA into microsomal phosphatidylcholine occurs mainly by the acylation of a 1-acyl-lysophosphatidylcholine acceptor rather than by acyl exchange between oleoyl-CoA and phosphatidylcholine. While the incorporation of oleoyl-CoA was completed within 2 to 5 min, exogenous 1-acyl-lysophosphatidylcholine was incorporated into phosphatidylcholine for up to 30 min. Addition of oleoyl-CoA resulted in an increase in both the rate and magnitude of lysophosphatidylcholine incorporation, which could not be accounted for by a stoichiometric reaction between the two substrates. Evidence is provided that free CoA had an independent stimulatory effect on the incorporation of lysophosphatidylcholine.

For these investigations, stable nitroxide radicals, 1-oxyl-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl 5,7-dimethyladamantane-1-carboxylate (DMAC-TEMPO), 5-doxylstearic acid (5-DSA) and 16-doxylstearic acid (16-DSA) were used as spin probes. Binding of the spin probes to the liposome membranes resulted in a substantial increase of the apparent rotational diffusion correlation times. The EPR spectra of the incorporated nitroxides underwent temperature-dependent changes. For every spin probe, values of apparent enthalpy and entropy of activation were calculated from the temperature dependence of rotational diffusion correlation times via Arrhenius equation. In case of DMAC-TEMPO, the data point to differences between the phospholipid bilayer of liposomes derived from sunflower and soy lecithin, and some similarity between the sunflower and egg yolk liposomes.

Phospholipase A(2)s (PLA(2)s) constitute a large superfamily of enzymes whose products are important for a multitude of signal transduction processes, lipid mediator release, lipid metabolism, development, plant stress responses, and host defense. The crystal structure of rice (Oryza sativa) isoform 2 phospholipase A(2) has been determined to 2.0 A resolution using sulfur SAD phasing, and shows that the class XIb phospholipases have a unique structure compared with other secreted PLA(2)s. The N-terminal half of the chain contains mainly loop structure, including the conserved Ca(2+)-binding loop, but starts with a short 3(10)-helix and also includes two short anti-parallel beta-strands. The C-terminal half is folded into three anti-parallel alpha-helices, of which the two first are also present in other secreted PLA(2)s and contain the conserved catalytic histidine and calcium liganding aspartate residues. The structure is stabilized by six disulfide bonds. The water structure around the calcium ion binding site suggests the involvement of a second water molecule in the mechanism for hydrolysis, the water-assisted calcium-coordinate oxyanion mechanism. The octanoate molecule in the complex structure is bound in a hydrophobic pocket, which extends to the likely membrane interface and is proposed to model the binding of the product fatty acid.

To that end, we studied main stem leaves obtained from plants growing in a temperature controlled greenhouse and at different times in the field season. We found that young leaves (∼5d old) had higher mid day temperatures, lower stomatal conductance and higher thermal optima as measured by ΦPSII temperature curves than did more mature leaves (∼13d old). Young leaves also had significant differences in fatty acid saturation with the warmer, young leaves having a higher proportion of palmitic acid (16:0) and lower linoleic acid (18:3) in total lipid extracts and higher 16:0 and lower palmitoleic acid (16:1) in the chloroplast membrane phosphoglycerides, digalactosyldiacylglycerol (in the greenhouse) and phosphatidylglycerol when compared with cooler, more mature leaves. Later in the growing season, leaf temperature, stomatal conductance and ΦPSII temperature curves for young and more mature leaves were similar and the proportion of 16:0 fatty acids decreased and 16:1 increased in phosphatidylglycerol.

In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), MGDG is predominantly synthesized by inner envelope-localized MONOGALACTOSYLDIACYLGLYCEROL SYNTHASE1 (MGD1); its knockout causes albino seedlings. Because of the lethal phenotype of the null MGD1 mutant, functional details of MGDG synthesis at seedling development have remained elusive. In this study, we used an inducible gene-suppression system to investigate the impact of MGDG synthesis on cotyledon development. We created transgenic Arabidopsis lines that express an artificial microRNA targeting MGD1 (amiR-MGD1) under the control of a dexamethasone-inducible promoter. The induction of amiR-MGD1 resulted in up to 75% suppression of MGD1 expression, although the resulting phenotypes related to chloroplast development were diverse, even within a line. The strong MGD1 suppression by continuous dexamethasone treatment caused substantial decreases in galactolipid content in cotyledons, leading to severe defects in the formation of thylakoid membranes and impaired photosynthetic electron transport. Time-course analyses of the MGD1 suppression during seedling germination revealed that MGDG synthesis at the very early germination stage is particularly important for chloroplast biogenesis. The MGD1 suppression down-regulated genes associated with the photorespiratory pathway in peroxisomes and mitochondria as well as those responsible for photosynthesis in chloroplasts and caused high expression of genes for the glyoxylate cycle.

We found that at full expansion of flag leaves in three lines, chloroplasts often showed oblong shapes with a typical membrane system of stroma and grana thylakoids, whereas their shapes had been changed from oblong to spherical during senescence. Our data showed that the initiation of senescence displayed accumulation of starch and an increase in the number and size of plastoglobuli with the damaged thylakoid membranes; subsequently, swollen thylakoid membranes in stroma and in grana with a significant increase in MDA content, and disorganization of thylakoid membrane system with significant changes in fatty acid composition of thylakoid membrane lipids were developed.

7298712,Addition of lipid to the photosynthetic membrane: effects on membrane structure and energy transfer.,"We have carried out a series of experiments in which the lipid composition of the photosynthetic membrane has been altered by the addition of lipid from a defined source under experimental conditions. Liposomes prepared by sonication are mixed with purified photosynthetic membranes obtained from spinach chloroplasts and are taken through cycles of freezing and thawing. Several lines of evidence, including gel electrophoresis and freeze-fracture electron microscopy, indicate that an actual addition of lipid has taken place. Structural analysis by freeze-fracture shows that intramembrane particles are widely separated after the addition of large amounts of lipid, with one exception: large hexagonal lattices of particles appear in some regions of the membrane. These lattices are identical in appearance with lattices formed from a single purified component of the membrane known as chlorophyll-protein complex II. The suggestion that the presence of such lattices in lipid-enriched membranes reflects a profound rearrangement of photosynthetic structures has been confirmed by analysis of the fluorescence emission spectra of natural and lipid-enriched membranes. Specifically, lipid addition in each of the cases we have studied results in the apparent detachment of chlorophyll-protein complex II from photosynthetic reaction centers.

Digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), a galactolipid abundant in chloroplasts, was detected in the PBM of soybean (Glycine max) and Lotus japonicus. Analyses of membrane marker proteins and of fatty acid composition confirmed that DGDG represents an authentic PBM lipid of plant origin and is not derived from the bacteria or from plastid contamination. In Arabidopsis, DGDG is known to accumulate in extraplastidic membranes during phosphate deprivation. However, the presence of DGDG in soybean PBM was not restricted to phosphate limiting conditions. Complementary DNA sequences corresponding to the two DGDG synthases, DGD1 and DGD2 from Arabidopsis, were isolated from soybean and Lotus. The two genes were expressed during later stages of nodule development in infected cells and in cortical tissue. Because nodule development depends on the presence of high amounts of phosphate in the growth medium, the accumulation of the non-phosphorus galactolipid DGDG in the PBM might be important to save phosphate for other essential processes, i.e. nucleic acid synthesis in bacteroids and host cells.",10.1074/jbc.M404098200,True,high,True,high,"[""Glycine max"", ""Lotus japonicus""]","[""galactolipid metabolism"", ""nodule membrane composition""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Glycine max"", ""Lotus japonicus""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), a galactolipid abundant in chloroplasts, was detected in the PBM of soybean (Glycine max) and Lotus japonicus."", ""Analyses of membrane marker proteins and of fatty acid composition confirmed that DGDG represents an authentic PBM lipid of plant origin and is not derived from the bacteria or from plastid contamination.""], ""explanation"": ""The study identifies and characterizes the galactolipid DGDG within the peribacteroid membrane of legume nodules, employing lipid extraction, fatty acid profiling, and gene isolation techniques to elucidate its role and origin, thereby directly investigating lipid composition and metabolism."", ""specific_topics"": [""galactolipid metabolism"", ""nodule membrane composition""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",6: Membrane Lipid Remodeling,success,6.0,Membrane Lipid Remodeling

2154256,Effect of detergents on the H(+)-ATPase activity of inside-out and right-side-out plant plasma membrane vesicles.,"In search for a detergent to be used to assess the sidedness of plant plasma membrane vesicles by enzyme latency we tested the effect of 42 detergents on the ATPase activity of right-side-out and inside-out plasma membrane vesicles from sugar beet leaves. Most of the detergents seemed to inactivate the ATPase in addition to disrupting the permeability barrier to ATP. There were two main exceptions, namely long chain polyoxyethylene acyl ethers, such as detergents of the Brij series and Lubrol WX, and long chain lysophospholipids. These two types of detergents permeabilized the membranes at low concentrations and did not inhibit the ATPase at higher concentrations. Unmasking of latent active sites seemed to explain the activation of the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase produced by long chain polyoxyethylene acyl ethers. These detergents should therefore be ideal for determination of vesicle orientation based on ATPase latency. By contrast, long chain lysophospholipids were found to be highly specific activators of the enzyme. In addition, long chain fatty acids were found to strongly inhibit ATP-dependent proton accumulation in the vesicles without inhibiting ATP hydrolysis. This uncoupling effect of the fatty acids could be abolished by the addition of fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA). Similarly, the proton transport capacity of ageing vesicles could be restored by addition of BSA. The latter findings may explain why isolated plasma membranes so often exhibit increased permeability to protons on ageing.",10.1016/0005-2736(90)90025-j,True,high,True,high,"[""sugar beet""]","[""fatty acid inhibition of proton accumulation"", ""lysophospholipid activation of ATPase"", ""detergent-induced membrane permeabilization""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""sugar beet""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""In addition, long chain fatty acids were found to strongly inhibit ATP-dependent proton accumulation in the vesicles without inhibiting ATP hydrolysis."", ""Long chain lysophospholipids were found to be highly specific activators of the enzyme.""], ""explanation"": ""The study examines how long\u2011chain fatty acids and lysophospholipids affect ATPase activity and proton transport in plant plasma membrane vesicles, directly addressing lipid\u2013protein interactions and lipid\u2011mediated regulation of membrane function."", ""specific_topics"": [""fatty acid inhibition of proton accumulation"", ""lysophospholipid activation of ATPase"", ""detergent-induced membrane permeabilization""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",6: Membrane Lipid Remodeling,success,6.0,Membrane Lipid Remodeling
27794502,Surveying the Oligomeric State of Arabidopsis thaliana Chloroplasts.,"Blue native-PAGE (BN-PAGE) resolves protein complexes in their native state. When combined with immunoblotting, it can be used to identify the presence of high molecular weight complexes at high resolution for any protein, given a suitable antibody. To identify proteins in high molecular weight complexes on a large scale and to bypass the requirement for specific antibodies, we applied a tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) approach to BN-PAGE-resolved chloroplasts. Fractionation of the gel into six bands allowed identification and label-free quantification of 1000 chloroplast proteins with native molecular weight separation. Significantly, this approach achieves a depth of identification comparable with traditional shotgun proteomic analyses of chloroplasts, indicating much of the known chloroplast proteome is amenable to MS/MS identification under our fractionation scheme. By limiting the number of fractionation bands to six, we facilitate scaled-up comparative analyses, as we demonstrate with the reticulata chloroplast mutant displaying a reticulated leaf phenotype. Our comparative proteomics approach identified a candidate interacting protein of RETICULATA as well as effects on lipid remodeling proteins, amino acid metabolic enzymes, and plastid division machinery.

10417698,"Targeted disruption of the plastid RNA polymerase genes rpoA, B and C1: molecular biology, biochemistry and ultrastructure.","The plastid encoded RNA polymerase subunit genes rpoA, B and C1 of tobacco were disrupted individually by PEG-mediated plastid transformation. The resulting off-white mutant phenotype is identical for inactivation of the different genes. The mutants pass through a normal ontogenetic cycle including flower formation and production of fertile seeds. Their plastids reveal a poorly developed internal membrane system consisting of large vesicles and, occasionally, flattened membranes, reminiscent of stacked thylakoids. The rpo- material is capable of synthesising pigments and lipids, similar in composition but at lower amounts than the wild-type. Western analysis demonstrates that plastids contain nuclear-coded stroma and thylakoid polypeptides including terminally processed lumenal components of the Sec but not of the DeltapH thylakoid translocation machineries. Components using the latter route accumulate as intermediates. In striking contrast, polypeptides involved in photosynthesis encoded by plastid genes could not be detected by Western analysis, although transcription of plastid genes, including the rrn operon, by the plastid RNA polymerase of nuclear origin is found as expected. Remarkably, ultrastructural, sedimentation and Northern analyses as well as pulse experiments suggest that rpo- plastids contain functional ribosomes. The detection of the plastid-encoded ribosomal protein Rpl2 is consistent with these results.

Since the discovery of peroxiredoxins in plants in 1996, a lot of work has been devoted to the biochemical and functional characterization of the different peroxiredoxin isoforms, but in contrast, few structural data are available. The analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome indicates that at least 17 isoforms of thioredoxin-dependent peroxidases are expressed in various plant compartments. The role of these proteins is discussed in terms of electron donor and substrate specificities and in light of their expression and localization.

28733391,Phospholipid:Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase-Mediated Triacylglyerol Synthesis Augments Basal Thermotolerance.,"High temperatures rapidly induce a genetically programmed heat-shock response (HSR) that is essential to establish short-term acquired thermotolerance. In addition, an immediate HSR-independent metabolic response is triggered, resulting in an accumulation of unsaturated triacylglycerols (TAGs) in the cytosol. The metabolic processes involved in heat-induced TAG formation in plants and their physiological significance remain to be clarified. Lipidomic analyses of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings indicated that during heat stress, polyunsaturated fatty acids from thylakoid galactolipids are incorporated into cytosolic TAGs. In addition, rapid conversion of plastidic monogalactosyl diacylglycerols (MGDGs) into oligogalactolipids, acylated MGDGs, and diacylglycerols (DAGs), the direct precursor of TAGs, was observed. For TAG synthesis, DAG requires a fatty acid from the acyl-CoA pool or phosphatidylcholine. Since seedlings deficient in PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1 (PDAT1) were unable to accumulate TAGs after heat stress, phosphatidylcholine appears to be the major fatty acid donor. Results suggest that rapid plastid lipid metabolism drives TAG accumulation during heat stress. PDAT1-mediated TAG accumulation was found to increase heat resistance, since nonacclimated <i>pdat1</i> mutant seedlings were more sensitive to severe heat stress, as indicated by a more dramatic decline of the maximum efficiency of PSII and lower seedling survival compared to wild-type seedlings. In contrast, nonacclimated <i>trigalactosyldiacylglycerol1</i> (<i>tgd1</i>) mutants overaccumulating TAGs and oligogalactolipids were more resistant to heat stress.

17717672,Increased senescence-associated gene expression and lipid peroxidation induced by iron deficiency in rice roots.,"Iron deficiency is among the most common nutritional disorders in plants. Low iron supply causes decreased root growth and even plant death. However, there are no reports about the specific pathways that lead Fe-deficient roots to senescence and death. To investigate the molecular mechanisms that regulate rice roots response to Fe-deficiency, rice seedlings were grown for 3, 6 and 9 days in the presence or absence of Fe. Sequences of 28 induced genes in rice roots under Fe-deficiency were identified by representational difference analysis (RDA). About 40% of these sequences have been previously reported as senescence-related. Differential expression of selected genes was confirmed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Classical senescence-related sequences, such as MYB and WRKY transcription factors, cysteine protease, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, lipid transfer protein, fatty acid hydroxylase, beta-glucosidase and cytochrome P450 oxydoreductase were identified. Fe-deficiency also resulted in decreased dry weight, increased lipid peroxidation (detected by TBA and histochemical methods) as well as evident membrane damage in Fe-deficient roots.

23615992,A non-targeted approach for extended liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry profiling of free and esterified jasmonates after wounding.,"Upon wounding or herbivory, plants quickly react by activating various defense mechanisms. A major part of these defenses is thought to be regulated by the jasmonate pathway through the induction of jasmonic acid and its biologically active jasmonoyl-isoleucine conjugate. Yet, these well-known phytohormones are only two among the numerous compounds that compose the jasmonate family. Here, we describe a method based on ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry that can potentially profile the full range of known free and esterified jasmonates in a non-targeted manner.

27811081,Reactive electrophilic oxylipins trigger a heat stress-like response through HSFA1 transcription factors.,"Abiotic and biotic stresses are often characterized by an induction of reactive electrophile species (RES) such as the jasmonate 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) or the structurally related phytoprostanes. Previously, RES oxylipins have been shown massively to induce heat-shock-response (HSR) genes including HSP101 chaperones. Moreover, jasmonates have been reported to play a role in basal thermotolerance. We show that representative HSR marker genes are strongly induced by RES oxylipins through the four master regulator transcription factors HSFA1a, b, d, and e essential for short-term adaptation to heat stress in Arabidopsis. When compared with Arabidopsis seedlings treated at the optimal acclimation temperature of 37 °C, the exogenous application of RES oxylipins at 20 °C induced a much weaker induction of HSP101 at both the gene and protein expression levels which, however, was not sufficient to confer short-term acquired thermotolerance. Moreover, jasmonate-deficient mutant lines displayed a wild-type-like HSR and were not compromised in acquiring thermotolerance. Hence, the OPDA- and RES oxylipin-induced HSR is not sufficient to protect seedlings from severe heat stress but may help plants to cope better with stresses associated with protein unfolding by inducing a battery of chaperones in the absence of heat.",10.1093/jxb/erw376,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""lipid\u2011derived signaling"", ""heat shock response"", ""transcription factor regulation""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Abiotic and biotic stresses are often characterized by an induction of reactive electrophile species (RES) such as the jasmonate 12\u2011oxo\u2011phytodienoic acid (OPDA) or the structurally related phytoprostanes."", ""Previously, RES oxylipins have been shown massively to induce heat\u2011shock\u2011response (HSR) genes including HSP101 chaperones.""], ""explanation"": ""The study investigates lipid\u2011derived oxylipins (such as OPDA and phytoprostanes), examining their role in triggering heat\u2011stress responses via HSFA1 transcription factors, thereby addressing fatty acid\u2013derived signaling pathways."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid\u2011derived signaling"", ""heat shock response"", ""transcription factor regulation""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",7: Lipid-related Stress Responses,success,7.0,Lipid-related Stress Responses
26946124,Root spatial metabolite profiling of two genotypes of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) reveals differences in response to short-term salt stress.,"Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is the most salt-tolerant cereal crop and has excellent genetic and genomic resources. It is therefore a good model to study salt-tolerance mechanisms in cereals. We aimed to determine metabolic differences between a cultivated barley, Clipper (tolerant), and a North African landrace, Sahara (susceptible), previously shown to have contrasting root growth phenotypes in response to the early phase of salinity stress. GC-MS was used to determine spatial changes in primary metabolites in barley roots in response to salt stress, by profiling three different regions of the root: root cap/cell division zone (R1), elongation zone (R2), and maturation zone (R3). We identified 76 known metabolites, including 29 amino acids and amines, 20 organic acids and fatty acids, and 19 sugars and sugar phosphates. The maintenance of cell division and root elongation in Clipper in response to short-term salt stress was associated with the synthesis and accumulation of amino acids (i.e. proline), sugars (maltose, sucrose, xylose), and organic acids (gluconate, shikimate), indicating a potential role for these metabolic pathways in salt tolerance and the maintenance of root elongation. The processes involved in root growth adaptation and the underlying coordination of metabolic pathways appear to be controlled in a region-specific manner.

29304736,Transcriptome analysis of response to Plasmodiophora brassicae infection in the Arabidopsis shoot and root.,"Clubroot is an important disease caused by the obligate parasite Plasmodiophora brassicae that infects the Brassicaceae. As a soil-borne pathogen, P. brassicae induces the generation of abnormal tissue in the root, resulting in the formation of galls. Root infection negatively affects the uptake of water and nutrients in host plants, severely reducing their growth and productivity. Many studies have emphasized the molecular and physiological effects of the clubroot disease on root tissues. The aim of the present study is to better understand the effect of P. brassicae on the transcriptome of both shoot and root tissues of Arabidopsis thaliana. Transcriptome profiling using RNA-seq was performed on both shoot and root tissues at 17, 20 and 24 days post inoculation (dpi) of A. thaliana, a model plant host for P. brassicae. The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between infected and uninfected samples was larger in shoot than in root. In both shoot and root, more genes were differentially regulated at 24 dpi than the two earlier time points. Genes that were highly regulated in response to infection in both shoot and root primarily were involved in the metabolism of cell wall compounds, lipids, and shikimate pathway metabolites. Among hormone-related pathways, several jasmonic acid biosynthesis genes were upregulated in both shoot and root tissue. Genes encoding enzymes involved in cell wall modification, biosynthesis of sucrose and starch, and several classes of transcription factors were generally differently regulated in shoot and root. These results highlight the similarities and differences in the transcriptomic response of above- and below-ground tissues of the model host Arabidopsis following P. brassicae infection. The main transcriptomic changes in root metabolism during clubroot disease progression were identified. An overview of DEGs in the shoot underlined the physiological changes in above-ground tissues following pathogen establishment and disease progression. This study provides insights into host tissue-specific molecular responses to clubroot development and may have applications in the development of clubroot markers for more effective breeding strategies.",10.1186/s12864-017-4426-7,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""lipid metabolism"", ""cell wall compound metabolism""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Genes that were highly regulated in response to infection in both shoot and root primarily were involved in the metabolism of cell wall compounds, lipids, and shikimate pathway metabolites.""], ""explanation"": ""The study reports differential expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, indicating that lipid processes are part of the plant's response to Plasmodiophora brassicae infection."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid metabolism"", ""cell wall compound metabolism""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",7: Lipid-related Stress Responses,success,7.0,Lipid-related Stress Responses

Considerable accumulation of FFA in aged chloroplasts of CS plants: bean and maize line F7-RpIII was accompanied by a marked inactivation of oxygen evolution. This relation was not, however, found in chloroplasts of CR species: pea, wheat and maize line EP1-RpI, in which the accumulation of FFA upon aging was very low whereas the decline of the rate of oxygen evolution was pronounced. In contrast to changes observed at pH 5.5, the inactivation of oxygen evolution in chloroplasts of CR species aged at pH 7.0 was dependent on the composition of the medium, especially in wheat chloroplasts. Thus, for the evaluation of chilling sensitivity based on the measurements of oxygen evolution activity solely, either aging of chloroplasts at pH 5.5 or possibly at pH 7.0 with NaCl included into the incubation medium may be recommended.

40408558,Synchrotron macro-ATR-FTIR: a powerful technique for analyzing changes in plant cell chemical composition after surfactant exposure.,"Surfactants, as foliar sprays, are widely used to increase the uptake of agrichemicals through plant leaf surfaces. Study of the effects of surfactants on plants has mainly focused on investigation of the mechanisms that underlie changes in droplet behavior on leaf surfaces. However, how surfactants may affect leaf chemical composition is largely unknown. The standard analysis techniques that have been widely used for leaf chemical analyses such as mass spectroscopy require complex and extensive sample preparation and leaf tissue destruction. Here, we have used an advanced technique, synchrotron macro-Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transformed InfraRed spectroscopy (synchrotron macro-ATR-FTIR), which provides a fast, non-destructive and in vivo method to capture the leaf surface and enable the chemical mapping of essential functional groups. The development of two Quasar workflows for analyzing complex FTIR data in this study highlights and strengthens the advantages of synchrotron macro-ATR-FTIR for plant research. We found that the treatment of 5-week-old maize (Zea mays L.) leaves with a commercial surfactant, Silwet-L-77, resulted in alterations in the FTIR spectral signatures associated with lipids, proteins and carbohydrates commencing 1 h after treatment.

12012174,SPME determination of volatile aldehydes for evaluation of in-vitro antioxidant activity.,"The in-vitro antioxidant activity of natural (essential oils, vitamin E) or synthetic substances ( tert-butyl hydroxy anisole (BHA), Trolox) has been evaluated by monitoring volatile carbonyl compounds released in model lipid systems subjected to peroxidation. The procedure employed methodology previously developed for the determination of carbonyl compounds as their pentafluorophenylhydrazine derivatives which were quantified, with high sensitivity, by means of capillary gas chromatography with electron-capture detection. Linoleic acid and sunflower oil were used as model lipid systems. Lipid peroxidation was induced in linoleic acid by the Fe2+ ion (1 mmol L-1, 37 degrees C, 12 h) and in sunflower oil by heating in the presence of O2 (220 degrees C, 2 h). The change in hexanal (the main lipoxidation product) concentration found in the lipid matrix subjected to oxidation with and without the substance being tested was used to calculate the antioxidant protection effect. These procedures were employed to evaluate the antioxidant activity of the essential oils of cilantro ( Coriander sativum L.), fennel ( Foeniculum vulgare Mill.), rosemary ( Rosmarinus officinalis L.), ""salvia negra"" ( Lepechinia schiedeana), and oregano ( Origanum vulgare L.), and the well-known antioxidants BHA, vitamin E, and Trolox, its water-soluble analog. In the sunflower oil system, the essential oils had a stronger protective effect against lipid peroxidation than BHA, vitamin E, and Trolox within the range of concentrations examined (1-20 g L-1).

16897477,Distinct developmental defense activations in barley embryos identified by transcriptome profiling.,"Proper embryo development is crucial for normal growth and development of barley. Numerous related aspects of this process--for example how the embryo establishes and sustains disease resistance for extended periods during dormancy--remain largely unknown. Here we report the results of microarray analyses of >22,000 genes, which together with measurements of jasmonic acid and salicylic acid during embryo development provide new information on the initiation in the developing barley embryo of at least two distinct types of developmental defense activation (DDA). Early DDA is characterized by the up-regulation of a specific set of genes around 20 days after flowering, including co-regulation of those for encoding 9-lipoxygenase and several oxylipin-generating enzymes, possibly leading to the formation of alpha-ketols. The same developmental phase includes an up-regulation of several defense genes, and indications of co-regulation of those for enzymes involved in the generation of phenylpropanoid phytoalexins. Late DDA is initiated prior to grain desiccation, around 37 days after flowering, with up-regulation of several genes encoding proteins with roles in antioxidant responses as well as a simultaneous up-regulation of several PR genes is notable. Throughout barley embryo development, there are no indications of an increased biosynthesis of either jasmonic acid or salicylic acid. Collectively, the results help explain how the proposed DDA enables protection of the developing barley embryo and grain for purposes of disease resistance.",10.1007/s11103-006-0034-7,True,high,True,high,"[""Hordeum vulgare""]","[""oxylipin synthesis"", ""lipoxygenase activity"", ""jasmonic acid pathway""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Hordeum vulgare""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Early DDA is characterized by the up\u2011regulation of a specific set of genes around 20 days after flowering, including co\u2011regulation of those for encoding 9\u2011lipoxygenase and several oxylipin\u2011generating enzymes, possibly leading to the formation of alpha\u2011ketols.""], ""explanation"": ""The study reports differential expression of genes involved in lipid\u2011derived signaling pathways such as 9\u2011lipoxygenase and oxylipin production, indicating investigation into lipid metabolism and its role in defense activation."", ""specific_topics"": [""oxylipin synthesis"", ""lipoxygenase activity"", ""jasmonic acid pathway""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",7: Lipid-related Stress Responses,success,7.0,Lipid-related Stress Responses

Differential scanning calorimetry has been used to search for any endotherms arising from lipid state changes in chloroplast lamellar membranes of the chilling-sensitive plants cantaloupe , kidney bean, domestic tomato, and soybean. For comparison, calorimetric scans of chloroplast lamellar membranes from the chilling-insensitive plants spinach, pea, and wild tomato were made. A large reversible endotherm, extending from below 10 degrees to nearly 40 degrees C, was observed in chloroplast membranes from tomatoes of both chilling-sensitive (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. cv. Floramerica ) and chilling-insensitive (L. hirsutum LA 1361) species. A much smaller endotherm, approximately 5 to 10% of the area of that seen in the two tomato species, and extending over a similar temperature range, was detected in chloroplasts from chilling-insensitive spinach and peas, and also was generally observed in chloroplasts from chilling-sensitive cantaloupe , kidney bean, and soybean. The enthalpy of these smaller endotherms indicates that, if the endotherm arose entirely from a lipid transition, then it corresponded to the melting of less than about 10% of the total membrane polar lipid. On the basis of these data it is concluded that there is no correlation between chilling sensitivity of photosynthesis and the presence or absence of a phase transition of bulk membrane lipids of the chloroplast lamellar membrane at temperatures above 5 degrees C.",10.1016/0003-9861(84)90396-5,True,high,True,high,"[""cantaloupe"", ""kidney bean"", ""domestic tomato"", ""soybean"", ""spinach"", ""pea"", ""wild tomato""]","[""lipid phase transition"", ""differential scanning calorimetry"", ""endotherm detection"", ""membrane lipid composition""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""cantaloupe"", ""kidney bean"", ""domestic tomato"", ""soybean"", ""spinach"", ""pea"", ""wild tomato""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""The phase transition of chloroplast lamellar membrane lipids has been proposed to be the underlying cause of chilling\u2011induced inhibition of photosynthesis in sensitive plants."", ""Differential scanning calorimetry has been used to search for any endotherms arising from lipid state changes in chloroplast lamellar membranes of the chilling\u2011sensitive plants cantaloupe , kidney bean, domestic tomato, and soybean.""], ""explanation"": ""The study explicitly examines lipid phase transitions in chloroplast membranes using calorimetry, directly addressing fatty acid/lipid behavior."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid phase transition"", ""differential scanning calorimetry"", ""endotherm detection"", ""membrane lipid composition""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",7: Lipid-related Stress Responses,success,7.0,Lipid-related Stress Responses

In the present study, responses of two maize cultivars (Rung Nong 35 and Dong Dan 80) were examined to explicate the growth, yield, leaf gas exchange, leaf water contents, osmolyte accumulation, membrane lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant activity under progressive drought stress. Maize cultivars were subjected to varying field capacities (FC) viz., well-watered (80 % FC) and drought-stressed (35 % FC) at 45 days after sowing. The effects of drought stress were analyzed at 5, 10, 15, 20, ad 25 days after drought stress (DAS) imposition. Under prolonged drought stress, Rung Nong 35 exhibited higher reduction in growth and yield as compared to Dong Dan 80. Maize cultivar Dong Dan 80 showed higher leaf relative water content (RWC), free proline, and total carbohydrate accumulation than Run Nong 35.

25579660,Deterioration mechanisms in air-dry pea seeds during early aging.,"The deteriorative reactions underlying seed aging, namely, lipid peroxidation and non-enzymatic carbohydrate hydrolysis, were studied in pea seeds differing in quality. Aging air-dry seeds were subdivided to three fractions using the application to individual seeds of room temperature phosphorescence. These fractions were strong seeds (fraction I) producing normal seedlings, weak seeds (fraction II) producing mainly abnormal seedlings, and dead seeds (fraction III). Enzymatic processes cannot operate in dry seeds due to the absence of free water, and thus an analytical method was needed that does not require the addition of water. The content of lipid peroxidation products was similar in both strong and weak seeds; this excluded the possibility that lipid peroxidation induced the transition of strong to weak seeds during early aging. Lipid peroxidation was activated only in dying seeds. However, glucose content in weak seeds was much higher than in strong seeds, suggestive of non-enzymatic hydrolysis of carbohydrates, probably of oligosaccharides, which utilized bound water in air-dry seeds. This process resulted in lowered water content in weak seeds. Therefore, associated with deterioration of air-dry seeds during early aging is the non-enzymatic hydrolysis of carbohydrates, whereas lipid peroxidation is not the decisive event.",10.1016/j.plaphy.2014.12.019,True,high,True,high,"[""Pisum sativum""]","[""lipid peroxidation"", ""fatty acid oxidation""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Pisum sativum""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""The deteriorative reactions underlying seed aging, namely, lipid peroxidation and non\u2011enzymatic carbohydrate hydrolysis, were studied in pea seeds differing in quality."", ""Lipid peroxidation was activated only in dying seeds.""], ""explanation"": ""The study explicitly examines lipid peroxidation\u2014a key lipid-related oxidative process\u2014in the context of seed aging, indicating direct investigation of lipid chemistry within plant tissues."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid peroxidation"", ""fatty acid oxidation""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",7: Lipid-related Stress Responses,success,7.0,Lipid-related Stress Responses
21384348,Effects of water-saving superabsorbent polymer on antioxidant enzyme activities and lipid peroxidation in corn (Zea mays L.) under drought stress.,"Drought is the most important abiotic stress factor limiting corn (Zea mays L.) growth and productivity. Therefore efficient management of soil moisture and study of metabolic changes in response to drought are important for improved production of corn. The objective of the present study was to gain a better understanding of drought tolerance mechanisms and improve soil water management strategies using a water-saving superabsorbent polymer (SAP) at 30 kg ha(-1) under three irrigation levels (adequate, moderate and deficit) using a new type of hydraulic pressure-controlled auto-irrigator. The results showed that relative water content and leaf water potential were much higher in corn treated with SAP. Although application of SAP reduced biomass accumulation by 11.1% under adequate irrigation, it increased the biomass markedly by 39.0% under moderate irrigation and 98.7% under deficit irrigation. Plants treated with SAP under deficit irrigation showed a significant decrease in superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase activities in leaves compared with control plants. The results of this study suggest that drought stress causes the production of oxygen radicals, leading to increased lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress in plants, and the application of a superabsorbent polymer could conserve soil water, making it available to plants for quenching oxidative stress and increasing biomass accumulation, especially under severe water stress.",10.1002/jsfa.4252,True,high,True,high,"[""Zea mays L.""]","[""lipid peroxidation"", ""oxidative stress""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Zea mays L.""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""The results of this study suggest that drought stress causes the production of oxygen radicals, leading to increased lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress in plants, and the application of a superabsorbent polymer could conserve soil water, making it available to plants for quenching oxidative stress and increasing biomass accumulation, especially under severe water stress.""], ""explanation"": ""The study explicitly reports increased lipid peroxidation as a consequence of drought-induced oxidative stress, indicating investigation of a lipid-related process."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid peroxidation"", ""oxidative stress""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",7: Lipid-related Stress Responses,success,7.0,Lipid-related Stress Responses

In this study, we showed that loss of the seed-specific WRKY DNA-BINDING PROTEIN 43 (WRKY43) conferred increased tolerance towards high salt, high osmolarity and low temperature during seed germination in Arabidopsis. The wrky43 loss of function lines displayed increased inhibition of seed germination in response to exogenous ABA; whereas lines overexpressing WRKY43 were more tolerant towards exogenous ABA. Biochemical analysis of fatty acid composition revealed that loss of WRKY43 increased polyunsaturated fatty acid content in seeds, particularly 18:2<sup>Δ9,12</sup> and 18:3<sup>Δ9,12,15</sup> in triacylglycerols and phospholipids, indicating an important physiological effect on fatty acid desaturation with ramifications for the tolerance of plants to cold and osmotic stress and possibly, for oilseed engineering. Molecular analyses showed that ABA-induced regulation of FUSCA3, ZAT10 and seed storage proteins were absent in the wrky43 mutant. In summary, WRKY43 encodes for a novel positive regulator of ABA-dependent gene regulation and as a potent modulator of fatty acid desaturation and seed filling, which results in increased tolerance to abiotic stress.",10.1038/s41598-017-14695-0,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""fatty acid desaturation"", ""triacylglycerol composition"", ""phospholipid composition"", ""lipid metabolism in seeds""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Biochemical analysis of fatty acid composition revealed that loss of WRKY43 increased polyunsaturated fatty acid content in seeds, particularly 18:2\\u03949,12 and 18:3\\u03949,12,15 in triacylglycerols and phospholipids,"", ""indicating an important physiological effect on fatty acid desaturation with ramifications for the tolerance of plants to cold and osmotic stress and possibly, for oilseed engineering.""], ""explanation"": ""The study directly measures changes in fatty acid profiles, specifically increases in polyunsaturated fatty acids within triacylglycerols and phospholipids, linking WRKY43 activity to lipid desaturation pathways."", ""specific_topics"": [""fatty acid desaturation"", ""triacylglycerol composition"", ""phospholipid composition"", ""lipid metabolism in seeds""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",7: Lipid-related Stress Responses,success,7.0,Lipid-related Stress Responses

The dependence of lipid peroxidation and the extent of antioxidant activity on the duration of irradiation was studied. It was shown that low doses of UV radiation (5-15 min) stimulate the antioxidant protection of green wheat sprouts grown for eight days. Increasing the irradiation time to 30-60 min leads to the inhibition of lipid peroxidation by the antioxidant system. A more prolonged irradiation of seeds with UV light (for 1-6 h) led to an increase in the level of lipid peroxidation in sprouts. However, 1-2-day-old sprouts from seeds irradiated for 5-6 h, adapted themselves to the influence due to the compensatory mechanisms. By the 8th day of germination of preliminarily irradiated seeds, the content of antioxidants and malone dialdehyde returned to the norm. The dynamics of activity of peroxidase in seeds irradiated with low doses of UV light for 30 min was studied. It was found that on the third day of seed germination, a decrease in peroxidase activity followed by its slight increase occurred.

To better understand this complex step in stress-responsive isoprenoid synthesis, we isolated three classes of cDNAS encoding HMGR (hmg1, hmg2, and hmg3) from a potato tuber library using a probe derived from an Arabidopsis HMGR cDNA. The potato cDNAs had extensive homology in portions of the protein coding regions but had low homology in the 3' untranslated regions. RNA gel blot analyses using gene-specific probes showed that hmg1 was strongly induced in tuber tissue by wounding, but the wound induction was strongly suppressed by treatment of the tissue with the fungal elicitor arachidonic acid or by inoculation with an incompatible or compatible race of the fungal pathogen Phytophtora infestans. The hmg2 and hmg3 mRNAs also accumulated in response to wounding, but in contrast to hmg1, these mRNAs were strongly enhanced by arachidonic acid or inoculation. Inoculation with a compatible race of P. infestans resulted in similar patterns in HMGR gene expression of hmg2 and hmg3 except that the magnitude and rate of the changes in mRNA levels were reduced relative to the incompatible interaction. The differential regulation of members of the HMGR gene family may explain in part the previously reported changes in HMGR enzyme activities following wounding and elicitor treatment. The suppression of hmg1 and the enhancement of hmg2 and hmg3 transcript levels following elicitor treatment or inoculation with the incompatible race parallel the suppression in steroid and stimulation of sesquiterpenoid accumulations observed in earlier investigations.

12746535,Chloroplast membrane photostability in chlP transgenic tobacco plants deficient in tocopherols.,"The phototolerance of three chlP transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) lines, affected in geranylgeranyl reductase and, hence, deficient in tocopherols (vitamin E), was estimated by in vivo luminescence and fluorescence measurements and was compared with that of the wild type (WT). Exposure of leaf discs to high light (1 mmol photon m(-2) s(-1)) and low temperature (10 degrees C) led to a rapid inhibition of photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry that showed little dependence on the tocopherol level. PSII photo-inhibition was followed by lipid peroxidation with a time delay of about 4 h, and this phenomenon was exacerbated in the tocopherol-deficient leaves. A linear correlation was observed in these short-term experiments between resistance to photooxidation and tocopherol content. When whole plants were exposed to the same treatment, PSII was severely photo-inhibited in mature leaves of all genotypes. Lipid peroxidation was also observed in all plants, but it occurred much more rapidly in tocopherol-deficient transgenic plants relative to WT plants. The time at which extensive lipid peroxidation occurred was correlated with the tocopherol content of the leaves. The present results show that tocopherols protect thylakoid membranes against photodestruction through lipid peroxidation. However, tocopherol deficiency was compensated in young, developing leaves that were able to photo-acclimate in the long term and did not suffer from photooxidative damage. Soluble antioxidants (glutathione and ascorbate) did not accumulate in photo-acclimated chlP transgenic leaves relative to WT leaves.

30404610,The initial deficiency of protein processing and flavonoids biosynthesis were the main mechanisms for the male sterility induced by SX-1 in Brassica napus.,"Rapeseed (Brassica napus) is an important oil seed crop in the Brassicaceae family. Chemical induced male sterility (CIMS) is one of the widely used method to produce the hybrids in B. napus. Identification of the key genes and pathways that involved in CIMS were important to understand the underlying molecular mechanism. In the present report, a multi-omics integrative analysis, including of the proteomic, transcriptomic and miRNAs, combined with morphological and physiological analysis were conducted. Earlier degeneration of the tapetosomes and elaioplasts, aberrantly stacking in tapetal cells and incompletely deposition in tryphine of pollen wall were observed in chemical hybridization agent (CHA) of SX-1 treated B. napus through SEM and TEM analysis. It was revealed that the deficiencies in protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and flavonoids biosynthesis were occurred at early stage in the SX-1 treated materials.

27813582,Genome-wide expression analysis of a rice mutant line under salt stress.,"Salinity is a major environmental stress to plants. In this study, the ability of plants to tolerate salt was investigated by studying growth, physiological characteristics, and expression levels of genes related to the salt-stress response in the salt-tolerant rice mutant (Till-II-877), which was derived from γ-ray irradiation. Compared to plants grown under normal conditions, the height and root length of wild type (WT) were reduced by approximately 40 and 29% following exposure to salt stress for 3 weeks, whereas Till-II-877 line showed 29 and 23% reductions in plant height and root length, respectively. No significant changes were observed in total chlorophyll content, and the malondialdehyde content of the mutant increased less than that of the WT under salt treatment. Gene expression was compared between the WT and mutant lines using microarray analysis. An unbiased analysis of the gene expression datasets allowed us to identify the pathways involved in salt-stress responses. Among the most significantly affected pathways, changes in gene expression were observed in α-linolenic acid and linoleic acid metabolism (in lipid metabolism), fructose and mannose metabolism and glycolysis-gluconeogenesis (in carbohydrate metabolism), cysteine and methionine metabolism (in amino acid metabolism), and carbon fixation (in the energy metabolism of photosynthetic organisms) under salt stress. These results show that the differential response of plants subjected to salt stress was due to changes in multiple metabolic pathways.

25711704,Growth-defence balance in grass biomass production: the role of jasmonates.,"Growth-defence balance is the selective partitioning of resources between biomass accumulation and defence responses. Although it is generally postulated that reallocation of limited carbon pools drives the antagonism between growth and defence, little is known about the mechanisms underlying this regulation. Jasmonates (JAs) are a group of oxylipins that are required for a broad range of responses from defence against insects to reproductive growth. Application of JAs to seedlings also leads to inhibited growth and repression of photosynthesis, suggesting a role for JAs in regulating growth-defence balance. The majority of JA research uses dicot models such as Arabidopsis and tomato, while understanding of JA biology in monocot grasses, which comprise most bioenergy feedstocks, food for human consumption, and animal feed, is limited. Interestingly, JA mutants of grasses exhibit unique phenotypes compared with well-studied dicot models. Gene expression analyses in bioenergy grasses also suggest roles for JA in rhizome development, which has not been demonstrated in Arabidopsis. In this review we summarize current knowledge of JA biology in panicoid grasses-the group that consists of the world's emerging bioenergy grasses such as switchgrass, sugarcane, Miscanthus, and sorghum.

40263511,Metabolomic responses of wheat grains to olive mill wastewater and drought stress treatments.,"The present research aimed to assess the metabolomic responses of wheat to olive mill wastewater (OMWW) and drought stress treatments. Wheat plants were cultivated under controlled conditions with the following treatments: control (75% field capacity, FC), OMWW (75 ml L<sup>-1</sup>), drought stress (40% FC, applied 30 days after sowing), and a combined treatment of OMWW and drought stress. Drought stress alone reduced grain yield by 67%, while the OMWW-treated plants resulted in a 29% reduction under stress relative to the control. OMWW application improved soil properties, enhancing organic matter and nutrient levels. Wheat grains from OMWW-treated plants exhibited higher sugar content and related enzyme activities, indicating improved metabolism, with significant increases in starch, fructose, and glucose levels alongside stable invertase and sucrose phosphate synthase activities.

Here we describe a new positive regulator, ICE2, which is a transcription factor of the bHLH family that participates in the response to deep freezing through the cold acclimation-dependent pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana plants. An overexpression of ICE2 (as we named the At1g12860 locus) in transgenic Arabidopsis plants results in increased tolerance to deep freezing stress after cold acclimation. The seeds of transgenic lines that overexpressed ICE2 were characterized by decreased levels of carbohydrate and increased levels of lipids. The analysis of expression of CBF1 gene (also known as DREB1B), which have been shown to be required for the complete development of cold acclimation response in Arabidopsis indicated a difference between expression of the CBF1 gene in transgenic plants and the wild-type control plants, Col-0.

17163881,Characterization of a BAHD acyltransferase responsible for producing the green leaf volatile (Z)-3-hexen-1-yl acetate in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"Green-leaf volatiles are commonly emitted from mechanically and herbivore-damaged plants. Derived from the lipoxygenase pathway, these compounds may serve as attractants to predators and parasitoids of herbivores, prevent the spread of bacteria and fungi, and induce several important plant defense pathways. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the major volatile released upon mechanical wounding of the leaves is the GLV ester, (Z)-3-hexen-1-yl acetate. We have characterized a member of the BAHD acyltransferase gene family At3g03480 which catalyzes the formation of (Z)-3-hexen-1-yl acetate from acetyl-CoA and (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol. The encoded acetyl CoA:(Z)-3-hexen-1-ol acetyltransferase (CHAT) has the ability to accept several medium-chain-length aliphatic and benzyl-derived alcohols, but has highest catalytic efficiency with (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol. The highest expression of CHAT occurs in the leaves and stems. Upon mechanical damage, the (Z)-3-hexen-1-yl acetate emission peaked after 5 min and declined to pre-damage levels after 90 min. However, CHAT gene transcript levels increased much more slowly with the highest levels detected between 3 and 6 h after wounding. An increase in CHAT enzyme activity in vitro followed the transcript increase, with levels peaking between 10 and 12 h after wounding. Plants expressing either an RNAi cassette for the CHAT gene or plants harboring a T-DNA insertion in the CHAT coding region had greatly reduced (Z)-3-hexen-1-yl acetate emission, showing that the CHAT enzyme is responsible for the in planta production of this ester.",10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02946.x,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""lipoxygenase pathway"", ""green leaf volatiles"", ""acyltransferase activity"", ""fatty acid-derived volatiles""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Derived from the lipoxygenase pathway, these compounds may serve as attractants to predators and parasitoids of herbivores, prevent the spread of bacteria and fungi, and induce several important plant defense pathways."", ""In Arabidopsis thaliana, the major volatile released upon mechanical wounding of the leaves is the GLV ester, (Z)-3-hexen-1-yl acetate.""], ""explanation"": ""The study characterizes a BAHD acyltransferase involved in synthesizing (Z)-3\u2011hexen\u20111\u2011yl acetate, a green leaf volatile generated through the lipoxygenase pathway, which originates from fatty acid oxidation.

By expressing the caleosin RESPONSIVE TO DESSICATION20 (RD20) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we show that the recombinant protein possesses an unusual peroxygenase activity with restricted specificity toward hydroperoxides of unsaturated fatty acid. Accordingly, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants overexpressing RD20 accumulate the product 13-hydroxy-9,11,15-octadecatrienoic acid, a linolenate-derived hydroxide. These plants exhibit elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with early gibberellin-dependent flowering and abscisic acid hypersensitivity at seed germination. These phenotypes are dependent on the presence of active RD20, since they are abolished in the rd20 null mutant and in lines overexpressing RD20, in which peroxygenase was inactivated by a point mutation of a catalytic histidine residue. RD20 also confers tolerance against stress induced by Paraquat, Rose Bengal, heavy metal, and the synthetic auxins 1-naphthaleneacetic acid and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Under oxidative stress, 13-hydroxy-9,11,15-octadecatrienoic acid still accumulates in RD20-overexpressing lines, but this lipid oxidation is associated with reduced ROS levels, minor cell death, and delayed floral transition.

Newly constructed transgenic Arabidopsis that overexpressed OsCEST or its Arabidopsis homologue AtCEST showed improved tolerance to salinity stress. OsCEST and AtCEST were mainly transcribed in photosynthetic tissues. Green fluorescent protein-fused OsCEST and AtCEST proteins were localized to the chloroplast in the Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts. CEST-overexpressing Arabidopsis showed enhanced tolerance not only to salt stress but also to drought stress, high-temperature stress, and paraquat, which causes photooxidative stress. Under saline conditions, overexpression of CESTs modulated the stress-induced impairment of photosynthetic activity and the peroxidation of lipids.

The photosensitizer used was meso-tetraphenylporphine. The time-course of the reaction was evaluated by ultraviolet (UV) spectra analysis. The 18:3(n - 3) photoperoxidation kinetics comprised three steps: monohydroperoxidation, characterized by the appearance of conjugated diene patterns; dihydroperoxidation characterized by the appearance of conjugated triene patterns, oxidative cleavage of the mono- and dihydroperoxides, characterized by the disappearance of conjugated patterns. In contrast, for hydrated plant total lipophilic extract photoperoxidation, conjugated pattern appearance was slow and the maximum plateau was not obtained. In order to explain plant extract behaviour, we tested the effects of beta-carotene and quercetin (important components of the chloroplast membrane) on the time-course of 18:3(n - 3) photoperoxidation. The first step was inhibited by beta-carotene implying that type II photoperoxidation involving singlet oxygen (1O2) was predominant. Whilst the two last steps were inhibited by quercetin implying that type I photoperoxidation involving free radicals, prevailed. Since 18:3(n - 3) foliar content decreased under water deficit, we tested the behaviour of total lipophilic extracts from droughted plant leaves in presence of reactive oxygen species.

28108698,Genome Wide Analysis of Fatty Acid Desaturation and Its Response to Temperature.,"Plants modify the polyunsaturated fatty acid content of their membrane and storage lipids in order to adapt to changes in temperature. In developing seeds, this response is largely controlled by the activities of the microsomal ω-6 and ω-3 fatty acid desaturases, FAD2 and FAD3. Although temperature regulation of desaturation has been studied at the molecular and biochemical levels, the genetic control of this trait is poorly understood. Here, we have characterized the response of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed lipids to variation in ambient temperature and found that heat inhibits both ω-6 and ω-3 desaturation in phosphatidylcholine, leading to a proportional change in triacylglycerol composition. Analysis of the 19 parental accessions of the multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population showed that significant natural variation exists in the temperature responsiveness of ω-6 desaturation. A combination of quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using the MAGIC population suggests that ω-6 desaturation is largely controlled by cis-acting sequence variants in the <i>FAD2</i> 5' untranslated region intron that determine the expression level of the gene. However, the temperature responsiveness of ω-6 desaturation is controlled by a separate QTL on chromosome 2.

Here, we examine the myristoylation and calcium binding properties of SOS3 and their functional significance in plant tolerance to salt. Treatment of young Arabidopsis seedlings with the myristoylation inhibitor 2-hydroxymyristic acid caused the swelling of root tips, mimicking the phenotype of the salt-hypersensitive mutant sos3-1. In vitro translation assays with reticulocyte showed that the SOS3 protein was myristoylated. Targeted mutagenesis of the N-terminal glycine-2 to alanine prevented the myristoylation of SOS3. The functional significance of SOS3 myristoylation was examined by expressing the wild-type myristoylated SOS3 and the mutated nonmyristoylated SOS3 in the sos3-1 mutant. Expression of the myristoylated but not the nonmyristoylated SOS3 complemented the salt-hypersensitive phenotype of sos3-1 plants. No significant difference in membrane association was observed between the myristoylated and nonmyristoylated SOS3. Gel mobility shift and (45)Ca(2)+ overlay assays demonstrated that SOS3 is a unique calcium binding protein and that the sos3-1 mutation substantially reduced the capacity of SOS3 to bind calcium. The resulting mutant SOS3 protein was not able to interact with the SOS2 protein kinase and was less capable of activating it.

24095921,Manganese-mitigation of cadmium toxicity to seedling growth of Phytolacca acinosa Roxb. is controlled by the manganese/cadmium molar ratio under hydroponic conditions.,"Manganese (Mn) can interact with cadmium (Cd) in environments and influence the toxic effect of Cd on plants. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between the Mn/Cd ratio and plant Cd-toxicity along Cd concentrations. In this paper, we studied the effects of external Mn/Cd molar ratios (0, 10, 30, 50 and 60) on Cd toxicity in the Mn hyperaccumulator and Cd tolerant plant, Phytolacca acinosa Roxb., at three Cd levels (50, 100 and 200 μM) under hydroponic conditions. Our result showed that seedling growth (y) under Cd stress was strongly positively related to the solution Mn/Cd molar ratio (SMCR). The relationship between the two variables under solution Cd concentrations was well explained by the linear regression model y=a+b1 (SMCR)+b2 (Solution-Cd). Increasing SMCR significantly reduced the Cd concentration and increased the Mn concentration in plant tissues. However, seedling growth was consistent with the shoot Mn/Cd molar ratio rather than with the Mn or Cd concentrations in plant tissues. At low levels of SMCR (e.g. 0 and 10), elevation of Mn distribution in shoot tissues might be a mechanism in P. acinosa seedlings to defend against Cd-toxicity. In comparison with low levels of SMCR, high levels of SMCR (e.g. 50 and 60) greatly alleviated lipid peroxidation and plant water-loss, and enhanced photosynthesis.

18641085,Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol deficiency in Arabidopsis affects pigment composition in the prolamellar body and impairs thylakoid membrane energization and photoprotection in leaves.,"Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) is the major lipid constituent of chloroplast membranes and has been proposed to act directly in several important plastidic processes, particularly during photosynthesis. In this study, the effect of MGDG deficiency, as observed in the monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase1-1 (mgd1-1) mutant, on chloroplast protein targeting, phototransformation of pigments, and photosynthetic light reactions was analyzed. The targeting of plastid proteins into or across the envelope, or into the thylakoid membrane, was not different from wild-type in the mgd1 mutant, suggesting that the residual amount of MGDG in mgd1 was sufficient to maintain functional targeting mechanisms. In dark-grown plants, the ratio of bound protochlorophyllide (Pchlide, F656) to free Pchlide (F631) was increased in mgd1 compared to the wild type. Increased levels of the photoconvertible pigment-protein complex (F656), which is photoprotective and suppresses photooxidative damage caused by an excess of free Pchlide, may be an adaptive response to the mgd1 mutation. Leaves of mgd1 suffered from a massively impaired capacity for thermal dissipation of excess light due to an inefficient operation of the xanthophyll cycle; the mutant contained less zeaxanthin and more violaxanthin than wild type after 60 min of high-light exposure and suffered from increased photosystem II photoinhibition.

30594795,Impact of Cr(VI) on the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in Helianthus annuus roots studied by metabolomic tools.,"The impact of Cr(VI) in sunflower roots has been studied, focusing on the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Plants were grown hydroponically in the presence of 0, 1.0, 5.0 and 25 mgCr L<sup>-1</sup>. Methanolic root extracts were analyzed by capillary liquid chromatography coupled through negative electrospray ionization to a quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry (capHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS). Using partial least squares algorithm, eighteen features strongly affected by Cr(VI) were detected and annotated as linoleic acid (LA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and sixteen oxidation products containing hydroperoxy-, epoxy-, keto-, epoxyketo- or hydroxy-functionalities, all of them classified as oxylipins. Inspection of the MS/MS spectra acquired for features eluting at different retention times but assigned as a sole compound, confirmed isomers formation: three hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic acids (HpODE), two oxo-octadecadienoic acids (OxoODE) and four epoxyketo-octadecenoic acids (EKODE). Around 70% of metabolites in sunflower LA metabolic pathway were affected by Cr(VI) stress and additionally, four EKODE isomers not included in this pathway were found in the exposed roots. Among ALA-derived oxylipins, 13-epi-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) is of relevance, because of its participation in the activation of secondary metabolism. The abundances of all oxylipins were directly dependent on the Cr(VI) concentration in medium; furthermore, autooxidation of LA to HpODE isomers was observed after incubation with Cr(VI). These results point to the direct involvement of Cr(VI) in non-enzymatic oxidation of fatty acids; since oxylipins are signaling molecules important in plant defensive response, their synthesis under Cr(VI) exposure sustains the ability of sunflower to grow in Cr(VI)-contaminated environments.",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.12.145,True,high,True,high,"[""Helianthus annuus""]","[""fatty acid oxidation"", ""oxylipin production"", ""lipid peroxidation""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Helianthus annuus""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""The impact of Cr(VI) in sunflower roots has been studied, focusing on the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids."", ""Using partial least squares algorithm, eighteen features strongly affected by Cr(VI) were detected and annotated as linoleic acid (LA), alpha\u2011linolenic acid (ALA) and sixteen oxidation products containing hydroperoxy\u2011, epoxy\u2011, keto\u2011, epoxyketo\u2011 or hydroxy\u2011functionalities, all of them classified as oxylipins.""], ""explanation"": ""The manuscript explicitly investigates how hexavalent chromium induces oxidative modifications of polyunsaturated fatty acids in sunflower roots, identifying specific fatty acids and their oxidized derivatives (oxylipins).

25489814,Cryopreservation affects ROS-induced oxidative stress and antioxidant response in Arabidopsis seedlings.,"Plant recovery status after cryopreservation by vitrification had a negative relationship to the oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings germinated for 48 h or 72 h with different survival tolerances were examined at five steps of cryopreservation, to determine the role of ROS (O2(-), H2O2 and OH) and antioxidant systems (SOD, POD, CAT, AsA and GSH) in cryo-injury. In addition, the effects of the steps on membrane lipid peroxidation were studied using malondialdehyde (MDA) as an indicator. The results indicated that H2O2-induced oxidative stress at the steps of dehydration and rapid warming was the main cause of cryo-injury of 48-h seedlings (high survival rate) and 72-h seedlings (no survival). The H2O2 was mainly generated in cotyledons, shoot tips and roots of seedlings as indicated by Amplex Red staining. Low survival of 72-h seedlings was associated with severe membrane lipid peroxidation, which was caused by increased OH generation activity and decreased SOD activity. The antioxidant-related gene expression by qRT-PCR and physiological assays suggested that the antioxidant system of 48-h seedlings were activated by ROS, and they mounted a defense against oxidative stress. A high level of ROS led to the weakening of the antioxidant system of 72-h seedlings. Correlation analysis indicated that enhanced antioxidant enzymes activities contributed to the high survival rate of 48-h seedlings, which could reflect by cryopreservation of antioxidant mutant seedlings. This model system indicated that elevated CAT activity and AsA content were determinants of cryogenic stress tolerance, whose manipulation could improve the recovery of seedlings after cryopreservation.",10.1016/j.cryobiol.2014.11.004,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""membrane lipid peroxidation"", ""malondialdehyde (MDA)""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""In addition, the effects of the steps on membrane lipid peroxidation were studied using malondialdehyde (MDA) as an indicator."", ""Low survival of 72-h seedlings was associated with severe membrane lipid peroxidation, which was caused by increased OH generation activity and decreased SOD activity.""], ""explanation"": ""The study explicitly measured membrane lipid peroxidation using MDA as an indicator, indicating direct investigation of lipid oxidation processes."", ""specific_topics"": [""membrane lipid peroxidation"", ""malondialdehyde (MDA)""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",7: Lipid-related Stress Responses,success,7.0,Lipid-related Stress Responses

The results showed that wheat seeds pretreated with a lower dose of PEG (12.5%) showed higher tolerance against osmotic stress as well as the up-regulation of heme oxygenase (HO, EC 1.14.99.3) and decreased lipid peroxidation during recuperation, compared to those with a higher dose of PEG (50%). Exposure of wheat seeds to 25% PEG, HO-1 inhibitor or specific scavenger of nitric oxide (NO) alone differentially led to seed germination inhibition. The PEG-induced inhibitory effects on seed germination were ameliorated by the HO-1 inducer hematin, CO or NO donor. Additionally, hematin was able to markedly boost the HO/CO system. However, the addition of the HO-1 inhibitor or the specific scavenger of NO not only reversed the protective effects conferred by hematin, but also blocked the up-regulation of HO/CO. In addition, hematin-driven NO production in wheat seeds under osmotic stress was confirmed.

26675361,A previously undescribed jasmonate compound in flowering Arabidopsis thaliana - The identification of cis-(+)-OPDA-Ile.,"Jasmonates (JAs) are plant hormones that integrate external stress stimuli with physiological responses. (+)-7-iso-JA-L-Ile is the natural JA ligand of COI1, a component of a known JA receptor. The upstream JA biosynthetic precursor cis-(+)-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (cis-(+)-OPDA) has been reported to act independently of COI1 as an essential signal in several stress-induced and developmental processes. Wound-induced increases in the endogenous levels of JA/JA-Ile are accompanied by two to tenfold increases in the concentration of OPDA, but its means of perception and metabolism are unknown. To screen for putative OPDA metabolites, vegetative tissues of flowering Arabidopsis thaliana were extracted with 25% aqueous methanol (v/v), purified by single-step reversed-phase polymer-based solid-phase extraction, and analyzed by high throughput mass spectrometry. This enabled the detection and quantitation of a low abundant OPDA analog of the biologically active (+)-7-iso-JA-L-Ile in plant tissue samples.

Cadmium (150 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) treatment caused a significant reduction in growth in terms of height and biomass accumulation and affected chlorophyll pigments, gas exchange parameters, and chlorophyll fluorescence. Selenium (10 μM) application mitigated the adverse effects of cadmium on growth, chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, leaf relative water content, and other physiological attributes. Lipid peroxidation and electrolyte leakage increased because of cadmium treatment and selenium-treated plants exhibited considerable reduction because of the decreased production of hydrogen peroxide in them. Cadmium-treated plants exhibited enhanced activity of antioxidant enzymes that protected cellular structures by neutralizing reactive free radicals. Supplementation of selenium to cadmium-treated plants (Cd + Se) further enhanced the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and glutathione reductase (GR) by 19.69, 31.68, 33.14, and 54.47%, respectively. Osmolytes, including proline and glycine betaine, increased with selenium application, illustrating their role in improving the osmotic stability of S. lycopersicum under cadmium stress.

We show that Arabidopsis plants with reduced levels of these plastid structural proteins are impaired in long-term acclimation to environmental constraint, namely photooxidative stress imposed by high light combined with cold. As a result, their photosynthetic apparatus is inefficiently protected. This leads to the prevalence of an abnormal granal and stromal membrane arrangement, as well as higher photosystem II photoinhibition under stress. The visible phenotype of FIB1-2 RNAi lines also includes retarded shoot growth and a deficit in anthocyanin accumulation under stress. All examined phenotypic effects of lower FIB levels are abolished by jasmonate (JA) treatment. An atypical expression pattern of several JA-induced genes was observed in RNAi plants. A JA-deficient mutant was found to share similar stress phenotypic characteristics with FIB RNAi plants. We conclude a new physiological role for JA, namely acclimation of chloroplasts, and that light/cold stress-related JA biosynthesis is conditioned by the accumulation of plastoglobule-associated FIB1-2 proteins.

More than 100 of the group I LEA genes, also termed Em genes, have been identified from plants, bacteria and animals. The wide distribution indicates the functional importance of these genes. In the present study, we characterized a novel Em-like gene, OsLEA1a of rice (Oryza sativa). The encoded OsLEA1a protein has an N-terminal sequence similar to that of other plant Em proteins but lacks a 20-mer motif that is the most significant feature of typical Em proteins. The location of the sole intron indicates that the second exon of OsLEA1a is the mutated product of a typical Em gene. Transcriptome analysis revealed OsLEA1a mainly expressed in embryos, with no or only a few transcripts in osmotic stress-treated vegetative tissues. Structural analysis revealed that the OsLEA1a protein adopts high amounts of disordered conformations in solution and undergoes desiccation-induced conformational changes. Macromolecular interaction studies revealed that OsLEA1a protein interacts with non-reducing sugars and phospholipids but not poly-l-lysine. Thus, although the OsLEA1a protein lost its 20-mer motif, it is still involved in the formation of bioglasses with non-reducing sugars or plasma membrane. However, the protein does not function as a chaperone as do other groups of hydrophilic LEA proteins. The orthologs of the OsLEA1a gene had been identified from various grasses but not in dicot plants. Genetic analysis indicated that rice OsLEA1a locates at a 193 kb segment in chromosome 1 and is conserved in several published cereal genomes.

30092779,Genome-wide identification of lipoxygenase gene family in cotton and functional characterization in response to abiotic stresses.,"Plant lipoxygenase (LOX) genes are members of the non-haeme iron-containing dioxygenase family that catalyze the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into functionally diverse oxylipins. The LOX family genes have been extensively studied under biotic and abiotic stresses, both in model and non-model plant species; however, information on their roles in cotton is still limited. A total of 64 putative LOX genes were identified in four cotton species (Gossypium (G. hirsutum, G. barbadense, G. arboreum, and G. raimondii)). In the phylogenetic tree, these genes were clustered into three categories (9-LOX, 13-LOX type I, and 13-LOX type II). Segmental duplication of putative LOX genes was observed between homologues from A2 to A<sub>t</sub> and D5 to D<sub>t</sub> hinting at allopolyploidy in cultivated tetraploid species (G. hirsutum and G. barbadense). The structure and motif composition of GhLOX genes appears to be relatively conserved among the subfamilies. Moreover, many cis-acting elements related to growth, stresses, and phytohormone signaling were found in the promoter regions of GhLOX genes. Gene expression analysis revealed that all GhLOX genes were induced in at least two tissues and the majority of GhLOX genes were up-regulated in response to heat and salinity stress. Specific expressions of some genes in response to exogenous phytohormones suggest their potential roles in regulating growth and stress responses. In addition, functional characterization of two candidate genes (GhLOX12 and GhLOX13) using virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) approach revealed their increased sensitivity to salinity stress in target gene-silenced cotton. Compared with controls, target gene-silenced plants showed significantly higher chlorophyll degradation, higher H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, malondialdehyde (MDA) and proline accumulation but significantly reduced superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, suggesting their reduced ability to effectively degrade accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS). This genome-wide study provides a systematic analysis of the cotton LOX gene family using bioinformatics tools. Differential expression patterns of cotton LOX genes in different tissues and under various abiotic stress conditions provide insights towards understanding the potential functions of candidate genes.

25498335,Priming with a double-stranded DNA virus alters Brassica rapa seed architecture and facilitates a defense response.,"Abiotic and biotic stresses alter genome stability and physiology of plants. Under some stressful situations, a state of stress tolerance can be passed on to the offspring rendering them more suitable to stressful events than their parents. In plants, the exploration of transgenerational response has remained exclusive to model species, such as Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we expand transgenerational research to include Brassica rapa, a close relative to economically important plant canola (Brassica napus), as it is exposed to the biotic stress of a double-stranded DNA virus Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV). Parent plants exposed to a low dose of 50ng purified CaMV virions just prior to the bolting stage produced significantly larger seeds than mock inoculated and healthy treatments. The progeny from these large seeds displayed resistance to the pathogen stress applied in the parental generation. Differences in defense pathways involving fatty acids, and primary and secondary metabolites were detected by de novo transcriptome sequencing of CaMV challenged progeny exhibiting different levels of resistance. Our study highlights biological and cellular processes that may be linked to the growth and yield of economically important B. rapa, in a transgenerational manner. Although much remains unknown as to the mechanisms behind transgenerational inheritance, our work shows a disease resistance response that persists for several weeks and is associated with an increase in seed size. Evidence suggests that a number of changes involved in the persistent stress adaption are reflected in the transcriptome.

26904057,Vacuolar H(+)-Pyrophosphatase AVP1 is Involved in Amine Fungicide Tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana and Provides Tridemorph Resistance in Yeast.,"Amine fungicides are widely used as crop protectants. Their success is believed to be related to their ability to inhibit postlanosterol sterol biosynthesis in fungi, in particular sterol-Δ(8),Δ(7)-isomerases and sterol-Δ(14)-reductases, with a concomitant accumulation of toxic abnormal sterols. However, their actual cellular effects and mechanisms of death induction are still poorly understood. Paradoxically, plants exhibit a natural resistance to amine fungicides although they have similar enzymes in postcicloartenol sterol biosynthesis that are also susceptible to fungicide inhibition. A major difference in vacuolar ion homeostasis between plants and fungi is the presence of a dual set of primary proton pumps in the former (V-ATPase and H(+)-pyrophosphatase), but only the V-ATPase in the latter. Abnormal sterols affect the proton-pumping capacity of V-ATPases in fungi and this has been proposed as a major determinant in fungicide action. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model fungus, we provide evidence that amine fungicide treatment induced cell death by apoptosis. Cell death was concomitant with impaired H(+)-pumping capacity in vacuole vesicles and dependent on vacuolar proteases. Also, the heterologous expression of the Arabidopsis thaliana main H(+)-pyrophosphatase (AVP1) at the fungal vacuolar membrane reduced apoptosis levels in yeast and increased resistance to amine fungicides. Consistently, A. thaliana avp1 mutant seedlings showed increased susceptibility to this amine fungicide, particularly at the level of root development. This is in agreement with AVP1 being nearly the sole H(+)-pyrophosphatase gene expressed at the root elongation zones. All in all, the present data suggest that H(+)-pyrophosphatases are major determinants of plant tolerance to amine fungicides.",10.3389/fpls.2016.00085,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""sterol biosynthesis"", ""fungicide mechanism via sterol interference""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Their success is believed to be related to their ability to inhibit postlanosterol sterol biosynthesis in fungi, in particular sterol\u2011\u0394(8),\u0394(7)-isomerases and sterol\u2011\u0394(14)-reductases, with a concomitant accumulation of toxic abnormal sterols."", ""Abnormal sterols affect the proton\u2011pumping capacity of V\u2011ATPases in fungi and this has been proposed as a major determinant in fungicide action.""], ""explanation"": ""The study investigates the impact of amine fungicides on sterol biosynthesis\u2014a key lipid metabolic pathway\u2014by examining how these compounds interfere with enzymes involved in producing sterol intermediates, thereby affecting fungal viability."", ""specific_topics"": [""sterol biosynthesis"", ""fungicide mechanism via sterol interference""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",7: Lipid-related Stress Responses,success,7.0,Lipid-related Stress Responses
29955111,Interaction between the barley allelochemical compounds gramine and hordenine and artificial lipid bilayers mimicking the plant plasma membrane.,"Some plants affect the development of neighbouring plants by releasing secondary metabolites into their environment. This phenomenon is known as allelopathy and is a potential tool for weed management within the framework of sustainable agriculture. While many studies have investigated the mode of action of various allelochemicals (molecules emitted by allelopathic plants), little attention has been paid to their initial contact with the plant plasma membrane (PPM). In this paper, this key step is explored for two alkaloids, gramine and hordenine, that are allelochemicals from barley. Using in vitro bioassays, we first showed that gramine has a greater toxicity than hordenine towards a weed commonly found in northern countries (Matricaria recutita L.). Then, isothermal titration calorimetry was used to show that these alkaloids spontaneously interact with lipid bilayers that mimic the PPM. The greater impact of gramine on the thermotropic behaviour of lipids compared to hordenine was established by means of infrared spectroscopy. Finally, the molecular mechanisms of these interactions were explored with molecular dynamics simulations.

25876181,Shoot and root phenotyping of the barley mutant kcs6 (3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase6) depleted in epicuticular waxes under water limitation.,"Aerial parts of plants are separated from the environment by a cuticle which functions in protection against desiccation and pathogen attack. Recently, we reported on a barley mutant with defect in the 3-KETOACYL-CoA-SYNTHASE (HvKCS6) gene, resulting in reduced coverage of the cuticle with epicuticular waxes. Spores of adapted and non-adapted powdery mildew fungi germinated less frequently on mutant leaves possibly because plant derived signals are missing. We used a shoot and root phenotyping facility to test whether depletion in epicuticular waxes negatively impacts plant performance under water-limiting conditions. While shoots of mutant plants grew slower at well-watered conditions than wild-type plants, they showed an equal or slightly better growth rate at water limitation. Also for roots, differences between mutant and parental line were less prominent at water-limiting as compared to well-watered conditions.

3075946,Plant senescence processes and free radicals.,"Free radicals acting at sensitive subcellular sites, appear to play a pivotal role in both the deleterious and beneficial effects of maturation and senescence of various plant organs--leaves, flowers, and fruit. As evidenced by ESR spectrometry, spin trapping, specific membrane phase transition studies and enzyme kinetics, an important factor in the above processes appears to be lipoxygenase activity producing polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) hydroperoxides and subsequently several free radical species and senescence-promoting compounds such as ethylene, malondialdehyde and jasmonic acid. The most intensely investigated are the oxy-free radical species including O2-., .OH, RO., ROO., PUFA and semiquinone free radicals. Higher plants are equipped with ways and means to combat free radicals and these may be classified under two general headings; (a) direct scavengers including SOD, ascorbic acid, and alpha-tocopherol acting in concert (b) incipient preventative mechanisms against radical formation, these include xanthine oxidase inhibitors, strategies based on endogenous H2O2 disposal in the form of peroxidative enzymes and glutathione turnover, and Ca2+ channel blockers. The antisenescence phytohormone cytokinin appears to possess a dual effect and may act in both capacities.

17040918,The Arabidopsis protein kinase PTI1-2 is activated by convergent phosphatidic acid and oxidative stress signaling pathways downstream of PDK1 and OXI1.,"Arabidopsis PDK1 activity is regulated by binding to the lipid phosphatidic acid (PA) resulting in activation of the oxidative stress-response protein kinase OXI1/AGC2-1. Thus there is an inferred link between lipid signaling and oxidative stress signaling modules. Among a panel of hormones and stresses tested, we found that, in addition to PA, the fungal elicitor xylanase activated PDK1, suggesting that PDK1 has a role in plant pathogen defense mechanisms. The downstream OXI1 was activated by additional stress factors, including PA, H(2)O(2), and partially by xylanase. We have isolated an interacting partner of OXI1, a Ser/Thr kinase (PTI1-2), which is downstream of OXI1. Its sequence closely resembles the tomato Pti kinase, which has been implicated in the hypersensitive response, a localized programmed cell death that occurs at the site of pathogen infection. PTI1-2 is activated by the same stresses/elicitors as OXI1 and additionally flagellin. We have used RNA interference to knock out the expression of PDK1 and OXI1 and to study the effects on PTI1-2 activity. We show that specific lipid signaling pathways converge on PTI1-2 via the PDK1-OXI1 axis, whereas H(2)O(2) and flagellin signals to OXI1-PTI1-2 via a PDK1-independent pathway.

29666162,Two Abscisic Acid-Responsive Plastid Lipase Genes Involved in Jasmonic Acid Biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>.,"Chloroplast membranes with their unique lipid composition are crucial for photosynthesis. Maintenance of the chloroplast membranes requires finely tuned lipid anabolic and catabolic reactions. Despite the presence of a large number of predicted lipid-degrading enzymes in the chloroplasts, their biological functions remain largely unknown. Recently, we described PLASTID LIPASE1 (PLIP1), a plastid phospholipase A<sub>1</sub> that contributes to seed oil biosynthesis. The <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> genome encodes two putative PLIP1 paralogs, which we designated PLIP2 and PLIP3. PLIP2 and PLIP3 are also present in the chloroplasts, but likely with different subplastid locations. In vitro analysis indicated that both are glycerolipid A<sub>1</sub> lipases. In vivo, PLIP2 prefers monogalactosyldiacylglycerol as substrate and PLIP3 phosphatidylglycerol. Overexpression of <i>PLIP2</i> or <i>PLIP3</i> severely reduced plant growth and led to accumulation of the bioactive form of jasmonate and related oxylipins. Genetically blocking jasmonate perception restored the growth of the <i>PLIP2/3</i>-overexpressing plants. The expression of <i>PLIP2</i> and <i>PLIP3</i>, but not <i>PLIP1</i>, was induced by abscisic acid (ABA), and <i>plip1 plip2 plip3</i> triple mutants exhibited compromised oxylipin biosynthesis in response to ABA.

22645576,Biochemical and Molecular-Genetic Characterization of SFD1's Involvement in Lipid Metabolism and Defense Signaling.,"The Arabidopsis thaliana SFD1 (suppressor of fatty acid desaturase deficiency1) gene (also known as GLY1) is required for accumulation of 34:6 (i.e., 18:3-16:3) monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and for the activation of systemic acquired resistance (SAR), an inducible defense mechanism that confers resistance against a broad spectrum of pathogens. SFD1, which has been suggested to be involved in lipid-based signaling in SAR, contains a putative chloroplast transit peptide and has glycerol-3-phosphate synthesizing dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) reductase (also referred as glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) activity. The goals of this study were to determine if the DHAP reductase activity and chloroplast localization are required for SFD1's involvement in galactolipid metabolism and SAR signaling. The crystal structure of a Leishmania mexicana glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used to model SFD1 structure and identify Lys194, Lys279, and Asp332 as potential catalytic site residues in SFD1. Mutational analysis of SFD1 confirmed that Lys194, Lys279, and Asp332 are critical for SFD1's DHAP reductase activity, and its involvement in SAR. SFD1 proteins with these residues individually substituted by Ala lacked DHAP reductase activity and were unable to complement the SAR defect of the sfd1 mutant. The SFD1-Ala279 protein was also unable to restore 34:6-MGDG content when expressed in the sfd1 mutant. In vivo imaging of a green fluorescent protein-tagged SFD1 protein demonstrated that SFD1 is targeted to the chloroplast. The N-terminal 43 amino acids, which are required for proper targeting of SFD1 to the chloroplast, are also required for SFD1's function in lipid metabolism and SAR.

40757242,A comprehensive review on the formation and mitigation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH4) in edible oils: From oilseeds to oils.,"Edible oils are susceptible to contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), particularly PAH4 compounds, which include Benz [a]anthracene, Chrysene, Benzo [b]fluoranthene, and Benzo [a]pyrene, all of which are recognized for their toxic and carcinogenic properties. This review examines the mechanisms underlying the formation of PAH4 in edible oils, with a particular focus on the transformation process from oilseeds to oils. Factors influencing the formation of PAH4 include environmental contamination, the composition of fatty acids, and processing methods such as extraction, refining, and cooking. High-temperature techniques, including roasting, frying, grilling, and baking, facilitate PAH4 formation through lipid oxidation and thermal decomposition. Conversely, low-temperature and short-duration treatments, such as cold pressing, along with refining processes, effectively reduce PAH4 levels in oils. Although detection methods such as High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) are reliable, they are also costly and time-consuming. In contrast, methods such as fluorescence spectroscopy, electrochemical sensors, and Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS)-based optical sensors are more appropriate for on-site rapid detection. To reduce PAH4 concentrations, it is advisable to select raw materials with minimal contamination, utilize cold pressing or refining techniques during processing, and choose oils that are low in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Additionally, employing low-temperature cooking methods, such as steaming or boiling, is recommended. The incorporation of antioxidants during both processing and cooking can further mitigate PAH4 levels.

Soil was amended following a D-optimal design and the mixtures (15 in total) were incubated during 30 d. At the end of the incubation, the effects of amendments on the assessed variables as well as the process modelling were evaluated by Response Surface Methodology (RSM).

25260337,Ectopic expression of Arabidopsis RCI2A gene contributes to cold tolerance in tomato.,"Cold is a major stress that limits the quality and productivity of economically important crops such as tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). Generating a cold-stress-tolerant tomato by expressing cold-inducible genes would increase agricultural strategies. Rare cold-inducible 2a (RCI2A) is expressed in Arabidopsis, but its molecular function during cold stress is not fully understood. Here we ectopically expressed Arabidopsis RCI2A in transgenic tomato to evaluate tolerance to cold stress without altering agronomic traits. Biochemical and physiological study demonstrated that expression of RCI2A in transgenic tomato enhanced the activity of peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and reduced the accumulation of H2O2, alleviated lipid peroxidation, increased the accumulation of chlorophyll, reduced chilling-induced membrane damage, retained relative water content and enhanced cold tolerance. A motif search revealed that the motifs of photosystem II (PSII) phosphoproteins PsbJ and PsbH and reaction-center proteins PsbL and PsbK were common to cold-inducible RCI2A and peroxidase proteins RCI3A, tomato peroxidase (TPX1), TPX2, tomato ascorbate peroxidase (APX1), and horseradish peroxidase (HRP-c).

23049960,Oxidative stress induced in sunflower seedling roots by aqueous dry olive-mill residues.,"The contamination of soils with dry olive-mill residue can represent a serious problem as being an environmental stressor in plants. It has been demonstrated that inoculation of aqueous extract of olive oil-mill residue (ADOR) with saprobe fungi removes some phenolic compounds. In this paper we studied the effect of ADOR uninoculated or inoculated with saprobe fungi in sunflower seedling roots. The germination and root growth, O(2)·(-) generation, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and extracellular peroxidases (EC-POXs) activities, and the content of some metabolites involved in the tolerance of stress were tested. The roots germinated in ADOR uninoculated show a decrease in meristem size, resulting in a reduction of the root length and fresh weight, and in the number of layers forming the cortex, but did not alter the dry weight, protein and soluble amino acid content. ADOR caused the decreases in O(2)·(-) generation and EC-POX's activities and protein oxidation, but enhanced SOD activity, lipid peroxidation and proline content. Fluorescence imaging showed that ADOR induced O(2)·(-) and H(2)O(2) accumulation in the roots. The increase in SOD and the decrease in EC-POX's activities might be involved in the enhancement of H(2)O(2) content and lipid peroxidation. Control roots treated with ADOR for 10 min show an oxidative burst. Roots germinated in ADOR inoculated with saprobe fungi partially recovered normal levels of ROS, morphological characteristics and antioxidant activities. These results suggested that treatment with ADOR caused a phytotoxic effect during germination inducing an oxidative stress.

These lipids are also believed to fulfill similar functions in plant cells, although many details concerning the components of a plant phosphoinositide system, and their regulation are still missing. Only recently have the different phosphoinositide isomers been unambiguously identified in plant cells. Another problem that hinders the study of the function of phosphoinositides and their derivatives, as well as the regulation of their metabolism, in plant cells is the need for a homogenous, easily obtainable material, from which the extraction and purification of phospholipids is relatively easy and quantitatively reproducible.

12376663,Activation of phospholipases C and D is an early response to a cold exposure in Arabidopsis suspension cells.,"The signaling events generated by a cold exposure are poorly known in plants. We were interested in checking the possible activation of enzymes of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in response to a temperature drop. In Arabidopsis suspension cells labeled with (33)PO(4)(3-), a cold treatment induces a rapid increase of phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) content. This production was due to the simultaneous activation of phospholipase C (through diacylglycerol kinase activity) and phospholipase D, as monitored by the production of inositol triphosphate and of transphosphatidylation product, respectively. Moreover, inhibitors of the phosphoinositide pathway and of diacylglycerol kinase reduced PtdOH production. Enzyme activation occurred immediately after cells were transferred to low temperature. The respective contribution of both kind of phospholipases in cold-induced production of PtdOH could be estimated. We created conditions where phospholipids were labeled with (33)PO(4)(3-), but with ATP being nonradioactive. In such conditions, the apparition of radioactive PtdOH reflected PLD activity. Thus, we demonstrated that during a cold stress, phospholipase D activity accounted for 20% of PtdOH production. The analysis of composition in fatty acids of cold-produced PtdOH compared with that of different phospholipids confirmed that cold-induced PtdOH more likely derived mainly from phosphoinositides. The addition of chemical reagents modifying calcium availability inhibited the formation of PtdOH, showing that the cold-induced activation of phospholipase pathways is dependent on a calcium entry.",10.1104/pp.006080,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis""]","[""phospholipase activity"", ""phosphatidic acid synthesis"", ""fatty acid composition"", ""lipid signaling""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""In Arabidopsis suspension cells labeled with (33)PO(4)(3-), a cold treatment induces a rapid increase of phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) content."", ""The analysis of composition in fatty acids of cold-produced PtdOH compared with that of different phospholipids confirmed that cold-induced PtdOH more likely derived mainly from phosphoinositides.""], ""explanation"": ""The study focuses on the activation of phospholipases C and D, leading to increased phosphatidic acid production and analyzes the fatty acid composition of this lipid, thereby directly addressing lipid metabolism and signaling."", ""specific_topics"": [""phospholipase activity"", ""phosphatidic acid synthesis"", ""fatty acid composition"", ""lipid signaling""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",7: Lipid-related Stress Responses,success,7.0,Lipid-related Stress Responses
22747913,Genome expression profile analysis reveals important transcripts in maize roots responding to the stress of heavy metal Pb.,"Lead (Pb) has become one of the most abundant heavy metal pollutants of the environment. With its large biomass, maize could be an important object for studying the phytoremediation of Pb-contaminated soil. In our previous research, we screened 19 inbred lines of maize for Pb concentration, and line 178 was identified to be a hyperaccumulator for Pb in both the roots and aboveground parts. To identify important genes and metabolic pathways related to Pb accumulation and tolerance, line 178 was underwent genome expression profile under Pb stress and a control (CK). A total of approximately 11 million cDNA tags were sequenced and 4 665 539 and 4 936 038 clean tags were obtained from the libraries of the test and CK, respectively. In comparison to CK, 2379 and 1832 genes were identified up- or downregulated, respectively, more than fivefolds under Pb stress. Interestingly, all the genes were related to cellular processes and signaling, information storage and processing or metabolism functions. Particularly, the genes involved in posttranslational modification, protein turnover and chaperones; signal transduction, carbohydrate transport and metabolism; and lipid transport and metabolism significantly changed under the treatment. In addition, seven pathways including ribosome, photosynthesis, and carbon fixation were affected significantly, with 118, 12, 34, 21, 18, 72 and 43 differentially expressed genes involved. The significant upregulation of the ribosome pathway may reveal an important secret for Pb tolerance of line 178.

16269166,Responses of antioxidant system in Arabidopsis thaliana suspension cells to the toxicity of microcystin-RR.,"Microcystins are cyclic heptapeptide hepatoxins produced by many species of cyanobacteria. The toxic effects and mechanism of microcystins on animals have been well studied both in vivo and in vitro. It was also reported that microcystins had adverse effects on plants. However, to our knowledge, there is no information about the toxic effects and mechanism of microcystins on plant suspension cells. In this study, Arabidopsis thaliana suspension cells were exposed to a range dose of microcystin-RR. Lipid peroxidation, a main manifestation of oxidative damage, was studied and a time- and dose-dependent increase in malondiadehyde was observed. In contrast, glutathione (GSH) levels in the cells decreased after 48 h treatment with 1 and 5mg/L of microcystin-RR. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) increased significantly after 48 h exposure to 1 and 5mg/L of microcystin-RR, but glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity showed no difference compared with the control. These results clearly indicate that microcystin-RR is able to cause oxidative damage in A. thaliana suspension cells. Decrease of GSH content and increases of SOD and CAT activities reveal that the antioxidant system may play an important role in eliminating or alleviating the toxicity of microcystin-RR.

26919986,"OeFAD8, OeLIP and OeOSM expression and activity in cold-acclimation of Olea europaea, a perennial dicot without winter-dormancy.","Cold-acclimation genes in woody dicots without winter-dormancy, e.g., olive-tree, need investigation. Positive relationships between OeFAD8, OeOSM , and OeLIP19 and olive-tree cold-acclimation exist, and couple with increased lipid unsaturation and cutinisation. Olive-tree is a woody species with no winter-dormancy and low frost-tolerance. However, cold-tolerant genotypes were empirically selected, highlighting that cold-acclimation might be acquired. Proteins needed for olive-tree cold-acclimation are unknown, even if roles for osmotin (OeOSM) as leaf cryoprotectant, and seed lipid-transfer protein for endosperm cutinisation under cold, were demonstrated. In other species, FAD8, coding a desaturase producing α-linolenic acid, is activated by temperature-lowering, concomitantly with bZIP-LIP19 genes. The research was focussed on finding OeLIP19 gene(s) in olive-tree genome, and analyze it/their expression, and that of OeFAD8 and OeOSM, in drupes and leaves under different cold-conditions/developmental stages/genotypes, in comparison with changes in unsaturated lipids and cell wall cutinisation. Cold-induced cytosolic calcium transients always occurred in leaves/drupes of some genotypes, e.g., Moraiolo, but ceased in others, e.g., Canino, at specific drupe stages/cold-treatments, suggesting cold-acclimation acquisition only in the latter genotypes. Canino and Moraiolo were selected for further analyses. Cold-acclimation in Canino was confirmed by an electrolyte leakage from leaf/drupe membranes highly reduced in comparison with Moraiolo. Strong increases in fruit-epicarp/leaf-epidermis cutinisation characterized cold-acclimated Canino, and positively coupled with OeOSM expression, and immunolocalization of the coded protein. OeFAD8 expression increased with cold-acclimation, as the production of α-linolenic acid, and related compounds. An OeLIP19 gene was isolated. Its levels changed with a trend similar to OeFAD8. All together, results sustain a positive relationship between OeFAD8, OeOSM and OeLIP19 expression in olive-tree cold-acclimation.

These enzymes have been mainly investigated using molecular, biochemical, and genetic approaches but very little is known about their subcellular distribution in plant cells. In this work, the precise subcellular localization of the omega3 desaturase FAD7 was elucidated by immunofluorescence and immunogold labeling using a monospecific GmFAD7 polyclonal antibody in soybean (Glycine max) photoautotrophic cell suspension cultures. Confocal analysis revealed the localization of the GmFAD7 protein within the chloroplast; i.e. signals from FAD7 and chlorophyll autofluorescence showed specific colocalization. Immunogold labeling was pursued on cryofixed and freeze-substituted samples for convenient preservation of antigenicity and ultrastructure of membrane subcompartments. Our data revealed that the FAD7 protein was preferentially localized in the thylakoid membranes.

24480404,Lipidomics in situ: insights into plant lipid metabolism from high resolution spatial maps of metabolites.,"The emergence of 'omics' technologies (i.e. genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.) have revealed new avenues for exploring plant metabolism through data-rich experimentation and integration of complementary methodologies. Over the past decade, the lipidomics field has benefited from advances in instrumentation, especially mass spectrometry (MS)-based approaches that are well-suited for detailed lipid analysis. The broad classification of what constitutes a lipid lends itself to a structurally diverse range of molecules that contribute to a variety of biological processes in plants including membrane structure and transport, primary and secondary metabolism, abiotic and biotic stress tolerances, extracellular and intracellular signaling, and energy-rich storage of carbon. Progress in these research areas has been advanced in part through approaches analyzing chemical compositions of lipids in extracts from cells, tissues and/or whole organisms (e.g. shotgun lipidomics), and through visualization approaches primarily through microscopy-based methodologies (e.g. fluorescence, bright field, electron microscopy, etc.). While these techniques on their own provide rich biochemical and biological information, coordinated analyses of the complexity of lipid composition with the localization of these lipids at a high spatial resolution will help to develop a new level of understanding of lipid metabolism within the context of tissue/cellular compartmentation. This review will elaborate on recent advances of one such approach--mass spectrometry imaging (MSI)--that integrates in situ visualization with chemical-based lipidomics.

29109252,Poaceae-specific <i>MS1</i> encodes a phospholipid-binding protein for male fertility in bread wheat.,"Male sterility is an essential trait in hybrid seed production for monoclinous crops, including rice and wheat. However, compared with the high percentage of hybrid rice planted in the world, little commercial hybrid wheat is planted globally as a result of the lack of a suitable system for male sterility. Therefore, understanding the molecular nature of male fertility in wheat is critical for commercially viable hybrid wheat. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of <i>Male Sterility 1</i> (<i>Ms1</i>) in bread wheat by using a combination of advanced genomic approaches. <i>MS1</i> is a newly evolved gene in the Poaceae that is specifically expressed in microsporocytes, and is essential for microgametogenesis. Orthologs of <i>Ms1</i> are expressed in diploid and allotetraploid ancestral species. Orthologs of <i>Ms1</i> are epigenetically silenced in the A and D subgenomes of allohexaploid wheat; only <i>Ms1</i> from the B subgenome is expressed. The encoded protein, Ms1, is localized to plastid and mitochondrial membranes, where it exhibits phospholipid-binding activity.

This seems to be due to interference with N-terminal protein acylation, which is of particular importance for protein kinases. Their N-myristoylation was found to be highly overrepresented in the proteome, whereas myristoylation motifs are almost absent in known chloroplast proteins. However, only abolishing their myristoylation was not sufficient to target those kinases to chloroplasts and resulted in nuclear accumulation instead. In contrast, inhibition of N-myristoylation of a calcium-dependent protein kinase was sufficient to alter its localization from the plasma membrane to chloroplasts and chloroplast localization of ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase and Rubisco activase could be efficiently suppressed by artificial introduction of myristoylation and palmitoylation sites.",10.1016/j.febslet.2011.01.001,True,high,True,high,,"[""N\u2011myristoylation"", ""palmitoylation"", ""protein targeting""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": null, ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""This seems to be due to interference with N-terminal protein acylation, which is of particular importance for protein kinases."", ""Their N-myristoylation was found to be highly overrepresented in the proteome, whereas myristoylation motifs are almost absent in known chloroplast proteins.""], ""explanation"": ""The study investigates how lipid-based post-translational modifications\u2014specifically N\u2011myristoylation and palmitoylation\u2014affect the subcellular localization of plant proteins, thereby directly addressing lipid modification processes."", ""specific_topics"": [""N\u2011myristoylation"", ""palmitoylation"", ""protein targeting""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",8: Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes,success,8.0,Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes
6630230,Preparation and characterization of membrane fractions enriched in outer and inner envelope membranes from spinach chloroplasts. II. Biochemical characterization.,"In the previous paper (Block, M. A., Dorne, A.-J., Joyard, J., and Douce, R. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 13273-13280), we have described a method for the separation of membrane fractions enriched in outer and inner envelope membranes from spinach chloroplasts. The two envelope membranes have a different weight ratio of acyl lipid to protein (2.5-3 for the outer envelope membrane and 0.8-1 for the inner envelope membrane). The two membranes also differ in their polar lipid composition. However, in order to prevent the functioning of the galactolipid:galactolipid galactosyltransferase during the course of envelope membrane separation, we have analyzed the polar lipid composition of each envelope membrane after thermolysin treatment of the intact chloroplasts. The outer envelope membrane is characterized by the presence of high amounts of phosphatidylcholine and digalactosyldiacylglycerol whereas the inner envelope membrane has a polar lipid composition almost identical with that of the thykaloids. No phosphatidylethanolamine or cardiolipin could be detected in either envelope membranes, thus demonstrating that the envelope membranes, and especially the outer membrane, do not resemble extrachloroplastic membranes. No striking differences were found in the fatty acid composition of the polar lipids from either the outer or the inner envelope membrane. The two envelope membranes also differ in their carotenoid composition. Among the different enzymatic activities associated with the chloroplast envelope, we have shown that the Mg2+-dependent ATPase, the UDP-Gal:diacylglycerol galactosyltransferase, the phosphatidic acid phosphatase, and the acyl-CoA thioesterase are associated with the inner envelope from spinach chloroplasts whereas the acyl-CoA synthetase is located on the outer envelope membrane.",,True,high,True,high,"[""Spinacia oleracea""]","[""polar lipid composition"", ""fatty acid composition"", ""lipid-associated enzymes""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Spinacia oleracea""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""The two envelope membranes have a different weight ratio of acyl lipid to protein (2.5-3 for the outer envelope membrane and 0.8-1 for the inner envelope membrane)."", ""No striking differences were found in the fatty acid composition of the polar lipids from either the outer or the inner envelope membrane.""], ""explanation"": ""The study characterizes the polar lipid composition and fatty acid profiles of outer and inner envelope membranes of spinach chloroplasts, directly addressing lipid biochemistry."", ""specific_topics"": [""polar lipid composition"", ""fatty acid composition"", ""lipid-associated enzymes""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",8: Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes,success,8.0,Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes
24121251,Metabolic labeling and membrane fractionation for comparative proteomic analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana suspension cell cultures.,"Plasma membrane microdomains are features based on the physical properties of the lipid and sterol environment and have particular roles in signaling processes. Extracting sterol-enriched membrane microdomains from plant cells for proteomic analysis is a difficult task mainly due to multiple preparation steps and sources for contaminations from other cellular compartments. The plasma membrane constitutes only about 5-20% of all the membranes in a plant cell, and therefore isolation of highly purified plasma membrane fraction is challenging. A frequently used method involves aqueous two-phase partitioning in polyethylene glycol and dextran, which yields plasma membrane vesicles with a purity of 95% (1). Sterol-rich membrane microdomains within the plasma membrane are insoluble upon treatment with cold nonionic detergents at alkaline pH. This detergent-resistant membrane fraction can be separated from the bulk plasma membrane by ultracentrifugation in a sucrose gradient (2). Subsequently, proteins can be extracted from the low density band of the sucrose gradient by methanol/chloroform precipitation. Extracted protein will then be trypsin digested, desalted and finally analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Our extraction protocol for sterol-rich microdomains is optimized for the preparation of clean detergent-resistant membrane fractions from Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures. We use full metabolic labeling of Arabidopsis thaliana suspension cell cultures with K(15)NO3 as the only nitrogen source for quantitative comparative proteomic studies following biological treatment of interest (3). By mixing equal ratios of labeled and unlabeled cell cultures for joint protein extraction the influence of preparation steps on final quantitative result is kept at a minimum. Also loss of material during extraction will affect both control and treatment samples in the same way, and therefore the ratio of light and heave peptide will remain constant.

23200047,Locating a lipid at the portal to the lipoxygenase active site.,"Lipoxygenase enzymes initiate diverse signaling pathways by specifically directing oxygen to different carbons of arachidonate and other polyunsaturated acyl chains, but structural origins of this specificity have remained unclear. We therefore determined the nature of the lipoxygenase interaction with the polar-end of a paramagnetic lipid by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Distances between selected grid points on soybean seed lipoxygenase-1 (SBL1) and a lysolecithin spin-labeled on choline were measured by pulsed (electron) dipolar spectroscopy. The protein grid was designed by structure-based modeling so that five natural side chains were replaced with spin labels. Pairwise distances in 10 doubly spin-labeled mutants were examined by pulsed dipolar spectroscopy, and a fit to the model was optimized. Finally, experimental distances between the lysolecithin spin and each single spin site on SBL1 were also obtained. With these 15 distances, distance geometry localized the polar-end and the spin of the lysolecithin to the region between the two domains in the SBL1 structure, nearest to E236, K260, Q264, and Q544. Mutation of a nearby residue, E256A, relieved the high pH requirement for enzyme activity of SBL1 and allowed lipid binding at pH 7.2.

24045023,The cytosolic nucleoprotein of the plant-infecting bunyavirus tomato spotted wilt recruits endoplasmic reticulum-resident proteins to endoplasmic reticulum export sites.,"In contrast with animal-infecting viruses, few known plant viruses contain a lipid envelope, and the processes leading to their membrane envelopment remain largely unknown. Plant viruses with lipid envelopes include viruses of the Bunyaviridae, which obtain their envelope from the Golgi complex. The envelopment process is predominantly dictated by two viral glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) and the viral nucleoprotein (N). During maturation of the plant-infecting bunyavirus Tomato spotted wilt, Gc localizes at endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes and becomes ER export competent only upon coexpression with Gn. In the presence of cytosolic N, Gc remains arrested in the ER but changes its distribution from reticular into punctate spots. Here, we show that these areas correspond to ER export sites (ERESs), distinct ER domains where glycoprotein cargo concentrates prior to coat protein II vesicle-mediated transport to the Golgi. Gc concentration at ERES is mediated by an interaction between its cytoplasmic tail (CT) and N. Interestingly, an ER-resident calnexin provided with Gc-CT was similarly recruited to ERES when coexpressed with N. Furthermore, disruption of actin filaments caused the appearance of a larger amount of smaller ERES loaded with N-Gc complexes, suggesting that glycoprotein cargo concentration acts as a trigger for de novo synthesis of ERES.",10.1105/tpc.113.114298,True,high,True,high,"[""tomato""]","[""lipid envelope formation"", ""membrane trafficking"", ""endoplasmic reticulum export sites""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""tomato""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""In contrast with animal-infecting viruses, few known plant viruses contain a lipid envelope, and the processes leading to their membrane envelopment remain largely unknown."", ""Plant viruses with lipid envelopes include viruses of the Bunyaviridae, which obtain their envelope from the Golgi complex.""], ""explanation"": ""The study explicitly discusses the presence of a lipid envelope in plant viruses and the mechanisms of membrane envelopment, indicating a focus on lipid-related processes."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid envelope formation"", ""membrane trafficking"", ""endoplasmic reticulum export sites""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",8: Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes,success,8.0,Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes
19892830,Suppression of peroxisome biogenesis factor 10 reduces cuticular wax accumulation by disrupting the ER network in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"Peroxisome biogenesis factor 10 (PEX10) is a component of the peroxisomal matrix protein import machinery. To analyze the physiological function of PEX10, we used transgenic AtPEX10i Arabidopsis plants that had suppressed expression of the PEX10 gene due to RNA interference. AtPEX10i plants had patches of paleness on leaves, and abnormal floral organs that were typical of cuticular wax-deficient mutants. Quantitative analysis of cuticular wax revealed that the amount of wax in AtPEX10i plants was indeed lower than that in control plants. This result was confirmed by toluidine blue staining and scanning electron microscopic analysis of AtPEX10i. The CER1, CER4, WAX2 and SHN1 genes are known to be responsible for wax biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. Of these, CER1, CER4 and WAX2 were found to be localized on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In AtPEX10i plants, the expression of these genes was down-regulated, and CER1, CER4 and WAX2 were mislocalized to the cytosol. We also found that AtPEX10i plants had defects in ER morphology. Based on these results, we propose that PEX10 is essential for the maintenance of ER morphology and for the expression of CER1, CER4, WAX2 and SHN1 genes, which contribute to the biosynthesis of cuticular wax.",10.1093/pcp/pcp152,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""cuticular wax biosynthesis"", ""lipid metabolism"", ""peroxisome role in lipid synthesis""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Quantitative analysis of cuticular wax revealed that the amount of wax in AtPEX10i plants was indeed lower than that in control plants."", ""The CER1, CER4, WAX2 and SHN1 genes are known to be responsible for wax biosynthesis in Arabidopsis.""], ""explanation"": ""The study focuses on cuticular wax accumulation, a lipid-based protective layer, and investigates genes involved in its biosynthesis, indicating direct relevance to lipid metabolism."", ""specific_topics"": [""cuticular wax biosynthesis"", ""lipid metabolism"", ""peroxisome role in lipid synthesis""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",8: Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes,success,8.0,Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes

18842056,Molecular dynamics simulation of the cooperative adsorption of barley lipid transfer protein and cis-isocohumulone at the vacuum-water interface.,"Molecular dynamic simulations have been carried out on systems containing a mixture of barley lipid transfer protein (LTP) and cis-isocohumulone (a hop derived iso-alpha-acid) in one of its enol forms, in bulk water and at the vacuum-water interface. In solution, the cis-isocohumulone molecules bind to the surface of the LTP molecule. The mechanism of binding appears to be purely hydrophobic in nature via desolvation of the protein surface. Binding of hop acids to the LTP leads to a small change in the 3-D conformation of the protein, but no change in the proportion of secondary structure present in helices, even though there is a significant degree of hop acid binding to the helical regions. At the vacuum-water interface, cis-isocohumulone shows a high surface activity and adsorbs rapidly at the interface. LTP then shows a preference to bind to the preadsorbed hop acid layer at the interface rather than to the bare water-vacuum interface. The free energy of adsorption of LTP at the hop-vacuum-water interface is more favorable than for adsorption at the vacuum-water interface. Our results support the view that hop iso-alpha-acids promote beer foam stability by forming bridges between separate adsorbed protein molecules, thus strengthening the adsorbed protein layer and reducing foam breakdown by lamellar phase drainage. The results also suggest a second mechanism may also occur, whereby the concentration of protein at the interface is increased via enhanced protein adsorption to adsorbed hop acid layers.

15548601,The Arabidopsis peroxisomal targeting signal type 2 receptor PEX7 is necessary for peroxisome function and dependent on PEX5.,"Plant peroxisomal proteins catalyze key metabolic reactions. Several peroxisome biogenesis PEROXIN (PEX) genes encode proteins acting in the import of targeted proteins necessary for these processes into the peroxisomal matrix. Most peroxisomal matrix proteins bear characterized Peroxisomal Targeting Signals (PTS1 or PTS2), which are bound by the receptors PEX5 or PEX7, respectively, for import into peroxisomes. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of an Arabidopsis peroxin mutant, pex7-1, which displays peroxisome-defective phenotypes including reduced PTS2 protein import. We also demonstrate that the pex5-1 PTS1 receptor mutant, which contains a lesion in a domain conserved among PEX7-binding proteins from various organisms, is defective not in PTS1 protein import, but rather in PTS2 protein import. Combining these mutations in a pex7-1 pex5-1 double mutant abolishes detectable PTS2 protein import and yields seedlings that are entirely sucrose-dependent for establishment, suggesting a severe block in peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation. Adult pex7-1 pex5-1 plants have reduced stature and bear abnormally shaped seeds, few of which are viable. The pex7-1 pex5-1 seedlings that germinate have dramatically fewer lateral roots and often display fused cotyledons, phenotypes associated with reduced auxin response.

3994672,Localization of chloroplastic fatty acid synthesis de novo in the stroma.,"The synthesis of fatty acids de novo from [2-14C]malonyl-CoA was studied in fractions from lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and pea (Pisum sativum) chloroplasts. When lettuce chloroplasts were subjected to osmotic lysis, disintegration through a Yeda press and high-speed centrifugation, essentially all of the fatty-acid-synthetic activity was found to be soluble. The distribution of the activity in various chloroplast fractions was similar to that of soluble marker enzymes such as ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase and NADP+-linked glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Marked differences were apparent in the quality of products from fatty acid synthesis de novo in the various fractions of chloroplasts. Thus soluble fractions produced predominantly stearate, whereas those containing membranes produced a greater proportion of palmitate. In pea chloroplasts, osmotic lysis released almost all of the fatty acid synthetase into the stromal fraction. In this instance, no major alterations in the products of fatty acid synthesis were observed.

Choline kinase (EC 2.7.1.32) was completely soluble, while phosphorylcholine-cytidyl transferase (EC 2.7.7.15) and phosphorylcholine-glyceride transferase (EC 2.7.8.2) were associated with particulate fractions. Although components sedimenting at 10,000 to 100,000 x g contained both enzymes, phosphorylcholine-cytidyl transferase and particularly phosphorylcholine-glyceride transferase were present in the 10,000 x g pellet, which contained the major organelles, mitochondria, and glyoxysomes. When the crude homogenate was centrifuged on a sucrose density gradient, four major bands of particulate protein were recovered. A band at density 1.24 g/cm(3) contained the glyoxysomes and was devoid of phosphorylcholine-cytidyl transferase and phosphorylcholine-glyceride transferase activity. Enzyme activity was barely detectable in the mitochondria, at density 1.18 g/cm(2).

10504576,"Protein dynamics, activity and cellular localization of soybean lipoxygenases indicate distinct functional roles for individual isoforms.","Vegetative lipoxygenases (VLXs) in soybean are hypothesized to function in nitrogen storage and partitioning. Isoform-specific antibodies for four of the five known VLX isoenzymes were used to investigate the influence of source-sink status on protein levels, as well as to analyze the tissue and subcellular localization of the different isoforms. VLXD responded most strongly to sink limitation, although the levels of VLXA, B and C increased as well. After sink limitation, VLXD and the vegetative storage protein, VSPalpha, accumulated in the vacuoles of bundle sheath and paraveinal mesophyll cells, while VLXA, B and C localized to the cytosol of these cells. All five known VLX isoenzymes were active with both linoleic and linolenic acid substrates after expression in Escherichia coli. The strong upregulation of VLXD levels after sink limitation as well as the localization of this isoform to the vacuoles of paraveinal mesophyll and bundle sheath cells (where VSPs are found) strongly suggest that VLXD should be considered as a major storage protein in soybean leaves. Furthermore, since VLXA, B and C also accumulate in sink-limited soybean leaves, are located in the cytosol of paraveinal mesophyll cells and are active at pH values typically found in this compartment, their activities may well contribute to lipid metabolism in this tissue.

A complete analysis to try to understand the molecular basis of the presence of CDPKs in various localizations in the cell has not been accomplished yet. It has been suggested that myristoylation may be responsible for membrane association of CDPKs. In this study, we used a rice CDPK, OSCPK2, which has a consensus sequence for myristoylation at the N-terminus, to address this question. We expressed wild-type OSCPK2 and various mutants in different heterologous systems to investigate the factors that affect its membrane association. The results show that OSCPK2 is myristoylated and palmitoylated and targeted to the membrane fraction. Both modifications are required, myristoylation being essential for membrane localization and palmitoylation for its full association. The fact that palmitoylation is a reversible modification may provide a mechanism for regulation of the subcellular localization.

The biosensor consists of a PA-binding domain of yeast SNARE Spo20p fused to fluorescent proteins. Live-cell imaging of PA dynamics in transiently transformed tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) pollen tubes was performed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. In growing pollen tubes, PA shows distinct annulus-like fluorescence pattern in the plasma membrane behind the extreme tip. Coexpression studies with markers for other plasmalemma signaling lipids phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and diacylglycerol revealed limited colocalization at the shoulders of the apex. PA distribution and concentrations show distinct responses to various lipid signaling inhibitors. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis suggests high PA turnover in the plasma membrane.

Plastocyanin was found to interact strongly enough with the lipid membrane to support an efficient electron transfer reaction with the electrode. The interaction forces, and therefore the mode of diffusion of plastocyanin molecules to the electrode, which limits the electron transfer rate, could be controlled by the PC concentration. At low lipid concentrations (0-5 mg/ml), electrostatically attractive interactions between specific microelectroactive sites on the surface of the lipid membrane and plastocyanin molecules predominate, producing a radial mode of diffusion of the protein molecules to the electrode surface. On the other hand, at high lipid concentrations (greater than 5 mg/ml), interaction between plastocyanin and the lipid membrane occurs via hydrophobic forces, and a linear diffusion of protein molecules limits the electron transfer process. These observations support and extend other experimental and theoretical results which indicate two possible sites on the surface of the plastocyanin molecule, one hydrophobic and one negatively charged, which are able to participate in electron transfer reactions.

27003250,Assessing compartmentalized flux in lipid metabolism with isotopes.,"Metabolism in plants takes place across multiple cell types and within distinct organelles. The distributions equate to spatial heterogeneity; though the limited means to experimentally assess metabolism frequently involve homogenizing tissues and mixing metabolites from different locations. Most current isotope investigations of metabolism therefore lack the ability to resolve spatially distinct events. Recognition of this limitation has resulted in inspired efforts to advance metabolic flux analysis and isotopic labeling techniques. Though a number of these efforts have been applied to studies in central metabolism; recent advances in instrumentation and techniques present an untapped opportunity to make similar progress in lipid metabolism where the use of stable isotopes has been more limited. These efforts will benefit from sophisticated radiolabeling reports that continue to enrich our knowledge on lipid biosynthetic pathways and provide some direction for stable isotope experimental design and extension of MFA. Evidence for this assertion is presented through the review of several elegant stable isotope studies and by taking stock of what has been learned from radioisotope investigations when spatial aspects of metabolism were considered. The studies emphasize that glycerolipid production occurs across several locations with assembly of lipids in the ER or plastid, fatty acid biosynthesis occurring in the plastid, and the generation of acetyl-CoA and glycerol-3-phosphate taking place at multiple sites. Considering metabolism in this context underscores the cellular and subcellular organization that is important to enhanced production of glycerolipids in plants. An attempt is made to unify salient features from a number of reports into a diagrammatic model of lipid metabolism and propose where stable isotope labeling experiments and further flux analysis may help address questions in the field.

16648627,Proteomics of plant detergent-resistant membranes.,"A large body of evidence from the past decade supports the existence, in membrane from animal and yeast cells, of functional microdomains that play important roles in protein sorting, signal transduction, or infection by pathogens. Recent reports demonstrated the presence, in plants, of detergent-resistant fractions isolated from plasma membrane. Analysis of the lipidic composition of this fraction revealed its enrichment in sphingolipids and sterols and depletion in phospho- and glycerolipids as previously observed for animal microdomains. One-dimensional gel electrophoresis experiments indicated that these detergent-resistant fractions are able to recruit a specific set of plasma membrane proteins and exclude others. In the present study, we used mass spectrometry to give an extensive description of a tobacco plasma membrane fraction resistant to solubilization with Triton X-100. This led to the identification of 145 proteins whose functional and physicochemical characteristics were analyzed in silico. Parameters such as isoelectric point, molecular weight, number and length of transmembrane segments, or global hydrophobicity were analyzed and compared with the data available concerning plant plasma membrane proteins. Post-translational modifications, such as myristoylation, palmitoylation, or presence of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, were examined in relation to the presence of the corresponding proteins in these microdomains. From a functional point of view, this analysis indicated that if a primary function of the plasma membrane, such as transport, seems under-represented in the detergent-resistant fraction, others undergo a significant increase of their relative importance.

These lipid domains provide a medium for protein signaling complexes at the plasma membrane and are also observed to be principal regions of membrane contact at the inception of infection. We visualized different specific fluorescent lipophilic stains of the both sphingolipid enriched and non-sphingolipid enriched regions in the plasma membranes of live protoplasts of Arabidopsis thaliana. Lipid staining protocols for several fluorescent lipid analogues in plants are presented. The most emphasis was placed on successful protocols for the single and dual staining of sphingolipid enriched regions and exclusion of sphingolipid enriched regions on the plasma membrane of Arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts. A secondary focus was placed to ensure that these staining protocols presented still maintain cell viability. Furthermore, the protocols were successfully tested with the spectrally sensitive dye Laurdan. Almost all existing staining procedures of the plasma membrane with fluorescent lipid analogues are specified for animal cells and tissues. In order to develop lipid staining protocols for plants, procedures were established with critical steps for the plasma membrane staining of Arabidopsis leaf tissue and protoplasts.

The phosphorescent probe erythrosin isothiocyanate was used to covalently label the gamma-polypeptide of DSA before reconstitution. Rotational correlation times were measured under a variety of conditions. The rotational correlation time was independent of the viscosity of the external medium but increased significantly as the microviscosity of the membrane increased. This indicates the rotational correlation times are a measure of the enzyme motion within the membrane. The activation energy associated with the rotational correlation time is 8-10 kcal/mol. At 4 degrees C, the correlation time, typically approximately 100-180 microseconds, was unaffected by the addition of substrates and the presence of a membrane pH gradient.

16805728,Association of Arabidopsis type-II ROPs with the plasma membrane requires a conserved C-terminal sequence motif and a proximal polybasic domain.,"Plant ROPs (or RACs) are soluble Ras-related small GTPases that are attached to cell membranes by virtue of the post-translational lipid modifications of prenylation and S-acylation. ROPs (RACs) are subdivided into two major subgroups called type-I and type-II. Whereas type-I ROPs terminate with a conserved CaaL box and undergo prenylation, type-II ROPs undergo S-acylation on two or three C-terminal cysteines. In the present work we determined the sequence requirement for association of Arabidopsis type-II ROPs with the plasma membrane. We identified a conserved sequence motif, designated the GC-CG box, in which the modified cysteines are flanked by glycines. The GC-CG box cysteines are separated by five to six mostly non-polar residues. Deletion of this sequence or the introduction of mutations that change its nature disrupted the association of ROPs with the membrane. Mutations that changed the GC-CG box glycines to alanines also interfered with membrane association. Deletion of a polybasic domain proximal to the GC-CG box disrupted the plasma membrane association of AtROP10. A green fluorescent protein fusion protein containing the C-terminal 25 residues of AtROP10, including its polybasic domain and GC-CG box, was primarily associated with the plasma membrane but a similar fusion protein lacking the polybasic domain was exclusively localized in the soluble fraction.

26938880,Spatio-Temporal Metabolite Profiling of the Barley Germination Process by MALDI MS Imaging.,"MALDI mass spectrometry imaging was performed to localize metabolites during the first seven days of the barley germination. Up to 100 mass signals were detected of which 85 signals were identified as 48 different metabolites with highly tissue-specific localizations. Oligosaccharides were observed in the endosperm and in parts of the developed embryo. Lipids in the endosperm co-localized in dependency on their fatty acid compositions with changes in the distributions of diacyl phosphatidylcholines during germination. 26 potentially antifungal hordatines were detected in the embryo with tissue-specific localizations of their glycosylated, hydroxylated, and O-methylated derivates. In order to reveal spatio-temporal patterns in local metabolite compositions, multiple MSI data sets from a time series were analyzed in one batch. This requires a new preprocessing strategy to achieve comparability between data sets as well as a new strategy for unsupervised clustering. The resulting spatial segmentation for each time point sample is visualized in an interactive cluster map and enables simultaneous interactive exploration of all time points. Using this new analysis approach and visualization tool germination-dependent developments of metabolite patterns with single MS position accuracy were discovered. This is the first study that presents metabolite profiling of a cereals' germination process over time by MALDI MSI with the identification of a large number of peaks of agronomically and industrially important compounds such as oligosaccharides, lipids and antifungal agents.

17558548,Chloroplast envelope membranes: a dynamic interface between plastids and the cytosol.,"Chloroplasts are bounded by a pair of outer membranes, the envelope, that is the only permanent membrane structure of the different types of plastids. Chloroplasts have had a long and complex evolutionary past and integration of the envelope membranes in cellular functions is the result of this evolution. Plastid envelope membranes contain a wide diversity of lipids and terpenoid compounds serving numerous biochemical functions and the flexibility of their biosynthetic pathways allow plants to adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions (for instance phosphate deprivation). A large body of knowledge has been generated by proteomic studies targeted to envelope membranes, thus revealing an unexpected complexity of this membrane system. For instance, new transport systems for metabolites and ions have been identified in envelope membranes and new routes for the import of chloroplast-specific proteins have been identified. The picture emerging from our present understanding of plastid envelope membranes is that of a key player in plastid biogenesis and the co-ordinated gene expression of plastid-specific protein (owing to chlorophyll precursors), of a major hub for integration of metabolic and ionic networks in cell metabolism, of a flexible system that can divide, produce dynamic extensions and interact with other cell constituents. Envelope membranes are indeed one of the most complex and dynamic system within a plant cell.

12748386,Crosstalk between cytosolic and plastidial pathways of isoprenoid biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"In plants, the formation of isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate, the central intermediates in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids, is compartmentalized: the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, which is localized to the cytosol, is responsible for the synthesis of sterols, certain sesquiterpenes, and the side chain of ubiquinone; in contrast, the recently discovered MVA-independent pathway, which operates in plastids, is involved in providing the precursors for monoterpenes, certain sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, carotenoids, and the side chains of chlorophylls and plastoquinone. Specific inhibitors of the MVA pathway (lovastatin) and the MVA-independent pathway (fosmidomycin) were used to perturb biosynthetic flux in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. The interaction between both pathways was studied at the transcriptional level by using GeneChip (Affymetrix) microarrays and at the metabolite level by assaying chlorophylls, carotenoids, and sterols. Treatment of seedlings with lovastatin resulted in a transient decrease in sterol levels and a transient increase in carotenoid as well as chlorophyll levels. After the initial drop, sterol amounts in lovastatin-treated seedlings recovered to levels above controls. As a response to fosmidomycin treatment, a transient increase in sterol levels was observed, whereas chlorophyll and carotenoid amounts decreased dramatically when compared with controls. At 96 h after fosmidomycin addition, the levels of all metabolites assayed (sterols, chlorophylls, and carotenoids) were substantially lower than in controls. Interestingly, these inhibitor-mediated changes were not reflected in altered gene expression levels of the genes involved in sterol, chlorophyll, and carotenoid metabolism. The lack of correlation between gene expression patterns and the accumulation of isoprenoid metabolites indicates that posttranscriptional processes may play an important role in regulating flux through isoprenoid metabolic pathways.",10.1073/pnas.1031755100,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""sterol biosynthesis"", ""isoprenoid pathway regulation""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""The mevalonate (MVA) pathway, which is localized to the cytosol, is responsible for the synthesis of sterols, certain sesquiterpenes, and the side chain of ubiquinone;"", ""Treatment of seedlings with lovastatin resulted in a transient decrease in sterol levels and a transient increase in carotenoid as well as chlorophyll levels.""], ""explanation"": ""The study directly measures sterol concentrations, a type of lipid, and investigates how inhibition of the MVA pathway affects sterol biosynthesis, indicating relevance to lipid metabolism."", ""specific_topics"": [""sterol biosynthesis"", ""isoprenoid pathway regulation""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",8: Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes,success,8.0,Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes
286305,Subcellular localization of acyl carrier protein in leaf protoplasts of Spinacia oleracea.,"This communication demonstrates that all de novo fatty acid biosynthesis in spinach leaf cells requires acyl carrier protein (ACP) and occurs specifically in the chloroplasts. Antibodies raised to purified spinach ACP inhibited at least 98% of malonyl CoA-dependent fatty acid synthesis by spinach leaf homogenates. Therefore, the presence of ACP in a compartment of the spinach leaf cell would serve as a marker for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. A radioimmunoassay capable of detecting 10(15) mol (10(-11) g) of spinach ACP was developed to measure the levels of ACP in leaf cell components isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation of a gentle lysate of spinach leaf protoplasts. All of the ACP of the leaf cell could be attributed to the chloroplast. Less than 1% of the ACP associated with chloroplasts resulted from binding of free ACP to chloroplasts. Of interest, ACP from Escherichia coli, soybean, and sunflower showed only partial crossreactivity with spinach ACP by the radioimmunoassay. These results strongly suggest that, in the leaf cell, chloroplasts are the sole site for the de novo synthesis of C16 and C18 fatty acids.

8462603,Characteristic and differential calcium signals from cell structures of the root cap detected by energy-filtering electron microscopy (EELS/ESI).,"Characteristic calcium signals were analyzed in structures of three cell types of the root cap of cress: statocytes, meristematic cells and secretion cells. Twenty-four hour-old roots were fixed with glutaraldehyde (postfixed with osmiate/potassium bichromate) or with potassium permanganate. No visible precipitates were formed, but calcium signals typical for different cell structures could be detected by means of energy-filtering transmission electron microscopy (EELS/ESI). In statocytes, calcium signals were recorded from the plasma membrane, the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, the amyloplast envelope and the mitochondrial membranes. In contrast to the excitable statocytes, the two other, non-excitable cell types, meristematic and secretion cells, exhibited much lower intensities of the calcium signals recorded from the same membrane systems. The revealed characteristic calcium-related properties of the different membrane systems may be related to the special function of statocytes, namely transduction of the gravity stimulus. In all three cell types, additional calcium signals were recorded from cell structures with well known calcium contents, i.e., mitochondrial granules, starch grains and cell walls. For the first time, clear calcium signals were detected from the lipid bodies which are mobilized during the developmental stage of the examined roots. It is supposed that free fatty acids and lipases are the binding sites for calcium. The reliability of the applied method is especially proven by comparison of the electron microscopic images from lipid bodies according to the two different fixation methods. After glutaraldehyde fixation followed by osmiate/potassium bichromate postfixation, the lipid bodies were well fixed and appeared homogeneously grey with homogeneous calcium signals. However, due to potassium permanganate fixation the lipid bodies were only partly fixed; they had an electron-lucid core, from which the lipids are lost during the dehydration procedure, without calcium signals and an electron-dense border zone, which is a reaction product of potassium permanganate with triacylglycerols, with calcium signals.",,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""lipid bodies"", ""triacylglycerols"", ""free fatty acids"", ""lipases""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""For the first time, clear calcium signals were detected from the lipid bodies which are mobilized during the developmental stage of the examined roots."", ""It is supposed that free fatty acids and lipases are the binding sites for calcium.""], ""explanation"": ""The study explicitly reports detection of calcium signals in lipid bodies and discusses the role of free fatty acids and lipases as potential calcium-binding sites, indicating a focus on lipid components and their metabolic processes."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid bodies"", ""triacylglycerols"", ""free fatty acids"", ""lipases""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",8: Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes,success,8.0,Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes

29692861,Bioorthogonal click chemistry for fluorescence imaging of choline phospholipids in plants.,"Phospholipids are important structural and signaling molecules in plant membranes. Some fluorescent dyes can stain general lipids of membranes, but labeling and visualization of specific lipid classes have yet to be developed for most components of the membrane. New techniques for visualizing membrane lipids are needed to further delineate their dynamic structural and signaling roles in plant cells. In this study we examined whether propargylcholine, a bioortholog of choline, can be used to label the major membrane lipid, phosphatidylcholine, and other choline phospholipids in plants. We established that propargylcholine is readily taken up by roots, and that its incorporation is not detrimental to plant growth. After plant tissue is harvested and fixed, a click-chemistry reaction covalently links the alkyne group of propargylcholine to a fluorescently-tagged azide, resulting in specific labeling of choline phospholipids. Uptake of propargylcholine, followed by click chemistry with fluorescein or Alexa Fluor 594 azide was used to visualize choline phospholipids in cells of root, leaf, stem, silique and seed tissues from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Co-localization with various subcellular markers indicated coinciding fluorescent signals in cell membranes, such as the tonoplast and the ER. Among different cell types in the leaf epidermis, guard cells displayed strong labeling. Mass spectrometry-based lipidomic analysis of the various plant tissues revealed that incorporation of propargylcholine was strongest in roots with approximately 50% of total choline phospholipids being labeled, but it was also incorporated in the other tissues including seeds. Phospholipid profiling confirmed that, in each tissue analyzed, incorporation of the bioortholog had little impact on the pool of choline plus choline-like phospholipids or other lipid species. We developed and validated a click-chemistry based method for fluorescence imaging of choline phospholipids using a bioortholog of choline, propargylcholine, in various cell-types and tissues from <i>Arabidopsis</i>. This click-chemistry method provides a direct way to metabolically tag and visualize specific lipid molecules in plant cells.

This study employs a multimodal mass spectrometric strategy to investigate the lipidomic uniqueness of the Zhongzi purple rice. The strategy combines matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) for spatial analysis, high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) for primary analysis, and high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI-HRMS/MS) for secondary analysis. MALDI-MSI identified seven metabolites in Zhongzi purple rice that exhibited germ-specific accumulation. In contrast, these metabolites showed markedly reduced signal intensities and lacked structured spatial distribution in conventional purple, black, and brown rice. Using a combination of lipidomic database interrogation, HRMS molecular formula validation, and APCI-HRMS/MS structural elucidation, we identified these metabolites as unsaturated fatty acid-enriched TAGs. Specifically, they were TAG(16:0/16:0/18:2), TAG(16:0/16:0/18:1), TAG(16:0/18:1/18:3), TAG(16:0/18:1/18:2), TAG(16:0/18:1/18:1), TAG(18:1/18:2/18:2), and TAG(18:1/18:1/18:2). The high unsaturation of these TAGs contributes to improved lipid hydrolysis efficiency, metabolic health benefits, and oxidative stability. These properties highlight Zhongzi purple rice as a potential functional food source. Due to their germ-specific accumulation, these compounds can act as potential biomarkers for authenticating Zhongzi purple rice and detecting adulterants. This provides a practical solution to commercial challenges in the industry.

25957952,A hydrophobic proline-rich motif is involved in the intracellular targeting of temperature-induced lipocalin.,"Temperature-induced lipocalins (TILs) play an essential role in the response of plants to different abiotic stresses. In agreement with their proposed role in protecting membrane lipids, TILs have been reported to be associated to cell membranes. However, TILs show an overall hydrophilic character and do not contain any signal for membrane targeting nor hydrophobic sequences that could represent transmembrane domains. Arabidopsis TIL (AtTIL) is considered the ortholog of human ApoD, a protein known to associate to membranes through a short hydrophobic loop protruding from strands 5 and 6 of the lipocalin β-barrel. An equivalent loop (referred to as HPR motif) is also present between β-strands 5 and 6 of TILs. The HPR motif, which is highly conserved among TIL proteins, extends over as short stretch of eight amino acids and contains four invariant proline residues. Subcellular localization studies have shown that TILs are targeted to a variety of cell membranes and organelles. We have also found that the HPR motif is necessary and sufficient for the intracellular targeting of TILs. Modeling studies suggest that the HPR motif may directly anchor TILs to cell membranes, favoring in this way further contact with the polar group of membrane lipids. However, some particular features of the HPR motif open the possibility that targeting of TILs to cell membranes could be mediated by interaction with other proteins.

26662549,Plant Cytosolic Acyl-CoA-Binding Proteins.,"A gene family encoding six members of acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBP) exists in Arabidopsis and they are designated as AtACBP1-AtACBP6. They have been observed to play pivotal roles in plant lipid metabolism, consistent to the abilities of recombinant AtACBP in binding different medium- and long-chain acyl-CoA esters in vitro. While AtACBP1 and AtACBP2 are membrane-associated proteins with ankyrin repeats and AtACBP3 contains a signaling peptide for targeting to the apoplast, AtACBP4, AtACBP5 and AtACBP6 represent the cytosolic forms in the AtACBP family. They were verified to be subcellularly localized in the cytosol using diverse experimental methods, including cell fractionation followed by western blot analysis, immunoelectron microscopy and confocal laser-scanning microscopy using autofluorescence-tagged fusions. AtACBP4 (73.2 kDa) and AtACBP5 (70.1 kDa) are the largest, while AtACBP6 (10.4 kDa) is the smallest. Their binding affinities to oleoyl-CoA esters suggested that they can potentially transfer oleoyl-CoA esters from the plastids to the endoplasmic reticulum, facilitating the subsequent biosynthesis of non-plastidial membrane lipids in Arabidopsis. Recent studies on ACBP, extended from a dicot (Arabidopsis) to a monocot, revealed that six ACBP are also encoded in rice (Oryza sativa). Interestingly, three small rice ACBP (OsACBP1, OsACBP2 and OsACBP3) are present in the cytosol in comparison to one (AtACBP6) in Arabidopsis. In this review, the combinatory and distinct roles of the cytosolic AtACBP are discussed, including their functions in pollen and seed development, light-dependent regulation and substrate affinities to acyl-CoA esters.",10.1007/s11745-015-4103-z,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana"", ""Oryza sativa""]","[""acyl\u2011CoA binding"", ""fatty acid transport"", ""membrane lipid biosynthesis""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana"", ""Oryza sativa""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""They have been observed to play pivotal roles in plant lipid metabolism, consistent to the abilities of recombinant AtACBP in binding different medium- and long-chain acyl-CoA esters in vitro."", ""Their binding affinities to oleoyl-CoA esters suggested that they can potentially transfer oleoyl-CoA esters from the plastids to the endoplasmic reticulum, facilitating the subsequent biosynthesis of non-plastidial membrane lipids in Arabidopsis.""], ""explanation"": ""The study focuses on acyl\u2011CoA\u2011binding proteins that bind medium\u2011 and long\u2011chain fatty acid CoA esters and facilitate their transfer between organelles, directly implicating fatty acid and lipid metabolism pathways."", ""specific_topics"": [""acyl\u2011CoA binding"", ""fatty acid transport"", ""membrane lipid biosynthesis""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",8: Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes,success,8.0,Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes

We present a comparative analysis of the genetic, functional, and cellular properties of tung type 1 and type 2 diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT1 and DGAT2), two unrelated enzymes that catalyze the committed step in TAG biosynthesis. We show that both enzymes are encoded by single genes and that DGAT1 is expressed at similar levels in various organs, whereas DGAT2 is strongly induced in developing seeds at the onset of oil biosynthesis. Expression of DGAT1 and DGAT2 in yeast produced different types and proportions of TAGs containing eleostearic acid, with DGAT2 possessing an enhanced propensity for the synthesis of trieleostearin, the main component of tung oil. Both DGAT1 and DGAT2 are located in distinct, dynamic regions of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and surprisingly, these regions do not overlap. Furthermore, although both DGAT1 and DGAT2 contain a similar C-terminal pentapeptide ER retrieval motif, this motif alone is not sufficient for their localization to specific regions of the ER. These data suggest that DGAT1 and DGAT2 have nonredundant functions in plants and that the production of storage oils, including those containing unusual fatty acids, occurs in distinct ER subdomains.",10.1105/tpc.106.043695,True,high,True,high,"[""Vernicia fordii""]","[""triacylglycerol biosynthesis"", ""eleostearic acid metabolism"", ""diacylglycerol acyltransferase function""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Vernicia fordii""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Seeds of the tung tree (Vernicia fordii) produce large quantities of triacylglycerols (TAGs) containing approximately 80% eleostearic acid, an unusual conjugated fatty acid."", ""Expression of DGAT1 and DGAT2 in yeast produced different types and proportions of TAGs containing eleostearic acid, with DGAT2 possessing an enhanced propensity for the synthesis of trieleostearin, the main component of tung oil.""], ""explanation"": ""The study characterizes diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT1 and DGAT2) that catalyze the committed step in triacylglycerol biosynthesis, focusing on the production and composition of TAGs rich in the fatty acid eleostearic acid, thereby directly investigating lipid metabolism in a plant system."", ""specific_topics"": [""triacylglycerol biosynthesis"", ""eleostearic acid metabolism"", ""diacylglycerol acyltransferase function""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",8: Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes,success,8.0,Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes
40455983,Concerted transport and phosphorylation of diacylglycerol at ER-PM contact sites regulate phospholipid dynamics during stress.,"A universal response of plants to environmental stresses is the activation of plasma membrane (PM) phospholipase C, which hydrolyzes phosphoinositides to produce soluble inositol phosphate and diacylglycerol (DAG). Because of their conical shape, DAG amounts have to be tightly regulated or they can destabilize membranes. We previously showed that upon stress, Synaptotagmin1 (SYT1) transports DAG from the PM to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) at ER-PM Contact Sites (CS). Here, we addressed the fate of the incoming DAG in the ER. We show that diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) DGK1 and DGK2 form a module with SYT1 functionally coupling DAG transport and phosphorylation at ER-PM CS. Although SYT1 and DGK1/DGK2 do not show exclusive ER-PM CS localization, their interaction occurs specifically at ER-PM CS and the removal of ER-PM CS abolishes the interaction. Lipidomic analysis of a <i>dgk1dgk2</i> double mutant supports that DGK1 and DGK2 phosphorylate DAG at the ER and transcriptomic and phenotypic analyses indicate that SYT1 and DGK1/DGK2 are functionally related. Taken together, our results highlight a mechanism at ER-PM CS that coordinates the transfer of DAG from the PM to the ER by SYT1 upon stress and the concomitant phosphorylation of DAG by DGK1 and DGK2 at the ER.

19036721,Definition of Arabidopsis sterol-rich membrane microdomains by differential treatment with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin and quantitative proteomics.,"Plasma membranes are dynamic compartments with key functions in solute transport, cell shape, and communication between cells and the environment. In mammalian cells and yeast, the plasma membrane has been shown to be compartmented into so-called lipid rafts, which are defined by their resistance to treatment with non-ionic detergents. In plants, the existence of lipid rafts has been postulated, but the precise composition of this membrane compartment is still under debate. Here we were able to experimentally clearly distinguish (i) true sterol-dependent ""raft proteins"" and (ii) sterol-independent ""non-raft"" proteins and co-purifying ""contaminants"" in plant detergent-resistant membranes. We used quantitative proteomics techniques involving (15)N metabolic labeling and specific disruption of sterol-rich membrane domains by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. Among the sterol-dependent proteins we found an over-representation of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins. A large fraction of these proteins has functions in cell wall anchoring. We were able to distinguish constant and variable components of plant sterol-rich membrane microdomains based on their responsiveness to the drug methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. Predominantly proteins with signaling functions, such as receptor kinases, G-proteins, and calcium signaling proteins, were identified as variable members in plant lipid rafts, whereas cell wall-related proteins and specific proteins with unknown functions make up a core set of sterol-dependent plant plasma membrane proteins.

23581493,Label-free chemically specific imaging in planta with stimulated Raman scattering microscopy.,"The growing world population puts ever-increasing demands on the agricultural and agrochemical industries to increase agricultural yields. This can only be achieved by investing in fundamental plant and agrochemical research and in the development of improved analytical tools to support research in these areas. There is currently a lack of analytical tools that provide noninvasive structural and chemical analysis of plant tissues at the cellular scale. Imaging techniques such as coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy provide label-free chemically specific image contrast based on vibrational spectroscopy. Over the past decade, these techniques have been shown to offer clear advantages for a vast range of biomedical research applications. The intrinsic vibrational contrast provides label-free quantitative functional analysis, it does not suffer from photobleaching, and it allows near real-time imaging in 3D with submicrometer spatial resolution. However, due to the susceptibility of current detection schemes to optical absorption and fluorescence from pigments (such as chlorophyll), the plant science and agrochemical research communities have not been able to benefit from these techniques and their application in plant research has remained virtually unexplored. In this paper, we explore the effect of chlorophyll fluorescence and absorption in CARS and SRS microscopy. We show that with the latter it is possible to use phase-sensitive detection to separate the vibrational signal from the (electronic) absorption processes. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of SRS for a range of in planta applications by presenting in situ chemical analysis of plant cell wall components, epicuticular waxes, and the deposition of agrochemical formulations onto the leaf surface.",10.1021/ac400266a,True,high,True,high,,"[""epicuticular waxes"", ""plant cell wall components""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": null, ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Finally, we demonstrate the potential of SRS for a range of in planta applications by presenting in situ chemical analysis of plant cell wall components, epicuticular waxes, and the deposition of agrochemical formulations onto the leaf surface.""], ""explanation"": ""The study uses stimulated Raman scattering microscopy to perform in situ chemical analysis of epicuticular waxes, which are lipid-based compounds, indicating investigation of lipid-related materials within plant tissues."", ""specific_topics"": [""epicuticular waxes"", ""plant cell wall components""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",8: Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes,success,8.0,Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes
15773854,Positional cues for the starch/lipid balance in maize kernels and resource partitioning to the embryo.,"This study tests the hypotheses that in vivo oxygen levels inside developing maize grains locally affect assimilate partitioning and ATP distribution within the kernel. These questions were addressed through combined topographical analysis (O2- and ATP-mapping), metabolite profiling, and isotope flux analysis. Internal and external oxygen levels were also experimentally altered. Under ambient conditions, mean O2 concentration immediately inside starchy endosperm dropped to only 1.4% of atmospheric saturation (approximately 3.8 microm), but was 10-fold higher in the oil-storing embryo. Increasing the O2 supply to intact kernels stimulated their O2 demand, shifted ATP localization within the kernel, and elevated their ATP/ADP ratio. Enhanced O2 availability also increased steady-state levels of glycolytic intermediates and those of the citric acid cycle, as well as some related pools of free amino acids. Subsequent analyses indicated that starch formation within endosperm, but not lipid biosynthesis within embryo, was adapted to the endogenous low oxygen. Increasing the O2 supply did not change ADP-glucose levels, activity of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, 13C-labeling of ADP-glucose, or flux of 14C-sucrose into starch. In contrast, enhanced O2 availability increased 14C-label uptake into the embryo, 13C-labeling of acetyl-coenzyme A, and finally 14C-incorporation into lipids. Lipid accumulation in embryo appeared highest in regions with higher ATP. Consistent with labeling data, a decrease in O2 supply most strongly affected the embryo, whereas rising O2 levels expanded ATP-rich zones toward the starch-storing endosperm and the scutellar part of embryo. The latter might be responsible for higher 14C-label uptake into the embryo and flux toward lipid. Collectively, data indicate that the in vivo oxygen distribution in maize kernels markedly affects ATP gradients, metabolite levels, and favors assimilate partitioning toward starch within the O2-depleted endosperm. Clear advantages are thus evident for peripheral localization of the protein and lipid storing structures in maize kernels.",10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02352.x,True,high,True,high,"[""Zea mays""]","[""lipid biosynthesis"", ""fatty acid synthesis"", ""metabolic flux""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Zea mays""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""In contrast, enhanced O2 availability increased 14C-label uptake into the embryo, 13C-labeling of acetyl\u2011coenzyme A, and finally 14C\u2011incorporation into lipids."", ""Lipid accumulation in embryo appeared highest in regions with higher ATP.""], ""explanation"": ""The study explicitly measures 14C incorporation into lipids and discusses lipid accumulation in the embryo, indicating direct investigation of lipid biosynthesis and metabolism."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid biosynthesis"", ""fatty acid synthesis"", ""metabolic flux""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",8: Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes,success,8.0,Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes
28720840,Positioning of the SCRAMBLED receptor requires UDP-Glc:sterol glucosyltransferase 80B1 in Arabidopsis roots.,"The biological function of sterol glucosides (SGs), the most abundant sterol derivatives in higher plants, remains uncertain. In an effort to improve our understanding of these membrane lipids we examined phenotypes exhibited by the roots of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) lines carrying insertions in the UDP-Glc:sterol glucosyltransferase genes, UGT80A2 and UGT80B1. We show that although ugt80A2 mutants exhibit significantly lower levels of total SGs they are morphologically indistinguishable from wild-type plants. In contrast, the roots of ugt80B1 mutants are only deficient in stigmasteryl glucosides but exhibit a significant reduction in root hairs. Sub-cellular investigations reveal that the plasma membrane cell fate regulator, SCRAMBLED (SCM), is mislocalized in ugt80B1 mutants, underscoring the aberrant root epidermal cell patterning. Live imaging of roots indicates that SCM:GFP is localized to the cytoplasm in a non cell type dependent manner instead of the hair (H) cell plasma membrane in these mutants. In addition, we provide evidence for the localization of the UGT80B1 enzyme in the plasma membrane. These data lend further support to the notion that deficiencies in specific SGs are sufficient to disrupt normal cell function and point to a possible role for SGs in cargo transport and/or protein targeting to the plasma membrane.",10.1038/s41598-017-05925-6,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""sterol glucosides"", ""membrane lipids"", ""root hair development""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""The biological function of sterol glucosides (SGs), the most abundant sterol derivatives in higher plants, remains uncertain."", ""In an effort to improve our understanding of these membrane lipids we examined phenotypes exhibited by the roots of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) lines carrying insertions in the UDP-Glc:sterol glucosyltransferase genes, UGT80A2 and UGT80B1.""], ""explanation"": ""The study focuses on sterol glucosides, a class of membrane lipids, investigating how mutations affecting their synthesis influence root development and protein localization."", ""specific_topics"": [""sterol glucosides"", ""membrane lipids"", ""root hair development""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",8: Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes,success,8.0,Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes

In animals the phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (PIPKs) are associated with the cytoskeleton through a scaffold of proteins; however, in plants such an interaction was not clear. Our approach was to determine which of the plant PIPKs interact with actin and determine whether the PIPK-actin interaction is direct. Our results indicate that AtPIPK1 interacts directly with actin and that the binding is mediated through a predicted linker region in the lipid kinase. AtPIPK1 also recruits AtPI4Kbeta1 to the cytoskeleton. Recruitment of AtPI4Kbeta1 to F-actin was dependent on the C-terminal catalytic domain of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase but did not require the presence of the N-terminal 251 amino acids, which includes 7 putative membrane occupation and recognition nexus motifs.

Using tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) 'Bright Yellow 2' cell suspension and leaves, evidence is provided that GIPCs represent up to 40 mol % of the PM lipids. Comparative analysis of DIMs with the PM showed an enrichment of 2-hydroxylated very-long-chain fatty acid-containing GIPCs and polyglycosylated GIPCs in the DIMs. Purified antibodies raised against these GIPCs were further used for immunogold-electron microscopy strategy, revealing the distribution of polyglycosylated GIPCs in domains of 35 ± 7 nm in the plane of the PM. Biophysical studies also showed strong interactions between GIPCs and sterols and suggested a role for very-long-chain fatty acids in the interdigitation between the two PM-composing monolayers.

24147788,A multi-colour/multi-affinity marker set to visualize phosphoinositide dynamics in Arabidopsis.,"Phosphatidylinositolphosphates (PIPs) are phospholipids that contain a phosphorylated inositol head group. PIPs represent a minor fraction of total phospholipids, but are involved in many regulatory processes, such as cell signalling and intracellular trafficking. Membrane compartments are enriched or depleted in specific PIPs, providing a unique composition for these compartments and contributing to their identity. The precise subcellular localization and dynamics of most PIP species is not fully understood in plants. Here, we designed genetically encoded biosensors with distinct relative affinities and expressed them stably in Arabidopsis thaliana. Analysis of this multi-affinity 'PIPline' marker set revealed previously unrecognized localization of various PIPs in root epidermis. Notably, we found that PI(4,5)P2 is able to localize PIP2 -interacting protein domains to the plasma membrane in non-stressed root epidermal cells. Our analysis further revealed that there is a gradient of PI4P, with the highest concentration at the plasma membrane, intermediate concentration in post-Golgi/endosomal compartments, and the lowest concentration in the Golgi. Finally, we also found a similar gradient of PI3P from high in late endosomes to low in the tonoplast.

18179651,Deposition and localization of lipid polyester in developing seeds of Brassica napus and Arabidopsis thaliana.,"Mature seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica napus contain complex mixtures of aliphatic monomers derived from non-extractable lipid polyesters. Most of the monomers are deposited in the seed coat, and their compositions suggest the presence of both cutin and suberin layers. The location of these polyesters within the seed coat, and their contributions to permeability of the seed coat and other functional properties are unknown. Polyester deposition was followed over Brassica seed development and distinct temporal patterns of monomer accumulation were observed. Octadecadiene-1,18-dioate, the major leaf cutin monomer, was transiently deposited. In contrast, the saturated dicarboxylates maintained a constant level during seed desiccation, whereas the fatty alcohols and saturated omega-hydroxy fatty acids continually increased. Dissection and analysis of Brassica seed coats showed that suberization is not specific to the chalaza. Analysis of the Arabidopsis ap2-7 mutant suggested that suberin monomers are preferentially associated with the outer integument. Several Arabidopsis knockout mutant lines for genes involved in polyester biosynthesis (att1, fatB and gpat5) were examined for seed monomer load and composition. The variance in polyester monomers of these mutants is correlated with dye penetration assays. Furthermore, stable transgenic plants expressing promoter::YFP fusions showed ATT1 promoter activity in the inner integument, whereas GPAT5 promoter is active in the outer integument. Together, the Arabidopsis data indicated that there is a suberized layer associated with the outer integument and a cutin-like polyester layer associated with the inner seed coat.",10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03348.x,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana"", ""Brassica napus""]","[""lipid polyester monomers"", ""cutin"", ""suberin"", ""fatty acid derivatives""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana"", ""Brassica napus""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Mature seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica napus contain complex mixtures of aliphatic monomers derived from non\u2011extractable lipid polyesters."", ""Octadecadiene\u20111,18\u2011dioate, the major leaf cutin monomer, was transiently deposited.""], ""explanation"": ""The study focuses on the synthesis, deposition, and composition of lipid polyesters such as cutin and suberin in seed coats, which are composed of fatty acid-derived monomers, directly addressing fatty acid and lipid processes."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid polyester monomers"", ""cutin"", ""suberin"", ""fatty acid derivatives""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",8: Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes,success,8.0,Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes
20814978,Application of imaging mass spectrometry for the analysis of Oryza sativa rice.,"Rice is one of the most important food crops in the world and new varieties have been bred for specific purposes, such as the development of drought-resistance, or the enrichment of functional food factors. The localization and composition of metabolites in such new varieties must be investigated because all artificial interventions are expected to change the metabolites of rice. Imaging mass spectrometry using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI-IMS) is a suitable tool for investigating the localization and composition of metabolites; however, suitable methodologies for the MALDI-IMS analysis of rice have not yet been established. In this study, we optimized the methods for analyzing rice grains by MALDI-IMS using adhesive film and found the characteristic distribution of metabolites in rice. Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) was localized in the endosperm. Phosphatidylcholine (PC), gamma-oryzanol and phytic acid were localized in the bran (germ and seed coat), and alpha-tocopherol was distributed in the germ (especially in the scutellum). In addition, MALDI-IMS revealed the LPC and PC composition of the rice samples. The LPC composition, LPC (1-acyl 16:0), LPC (1-acyl 18:2), LPC (1-acyl 18:1) and LPC (1-acyl 18:0), was 59.4 +/- 4.5%, 19.6 +/- 2.5%, 14.2 +/- 4.5% and 6.8 +/- 1.4%.

17922845,Expression of the recombinant bacterial outer surface protein A in tobacco chloroplasts leads to thylakoid localization and loss of photosynthesis.,"Bacterial lipoproteins play crucial roles in host-pathogen interactions and pathogenesis and are important targets for the immune system. A prominent example is the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi, which has been efficiently used as a vaccine for the prevention of Lyme disease. In a previous study, OspA could be produced in tobacco chloroplasts in a lipidated and immunogenic form. To further explore the potential of chloroplasts for the production of bacterial lipoproteins, the role of the N-terminal leader sequence was investigated. The amount of recombinant OspA could be increased up to ten-fold by the variation of the insertion site in the chloroplast genome. Analysis of OspA mutants revealed that replacement of the invariant cysteine residue as well as deletion of the leader sequence abolishes palmitolyation of OspA. Also, decoration of OspA with an N-terminal eukaryotic lipidation motif does not lead to palmitoylation in chloroplasts. Strikingly, the bacterial signal peptide of OspA efficiently targets the protein to thylakoids, and causes a mutant phenotype. Plants accumulating OspA at 10% total soluble protein could not grow without exogenously supplied sugars and rapidly died after transfer to soil under greenhouse conditions. The plants were found to be strongly affected in photosystem II, as revealed by the analyses of temporal and spatial dynamics of photosynthetic activity by chlorophyll fluorescence imaging.

Transgenic barley plants overexpressing LOX2:Hv:1 were generated by biolistics of scutella from immature embryos. Transformation frequency for 35S::LOX with or without cTP was in a range known for barley particle bombardment, whereas for Ubi::cTP-LOX no transgenic plants were detected. In general, a high number of green plantlets selected on bialaphos became yellow and finally died either in vitro or after potting. All transgenic plants obtained were phenotypically indistinguishable from wild type plants and all of them set seeds.

24958714,Plasma membrane localization is essential for Oryza sativa Pto-interacting protein 1a-mediated negative regulation of immune signaling in rice.,"Oryza sativa Pto-interacting protein 1a (OsPti1a), an ortholog of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) SlPti1, functions as a negative regulator of innate immunity in rice (Oryza sativa). In ospti1a mutants, the activation of immune responses, including hypersensitive response-like cell death, is caused by loss of the OsPti1a protein; however, it is as yet unclear how OsPti1a suppresses immune responses. Here, we report that OsPti1a localizes to detergent-resistant membrane fractions of the plasma membrane through lipid modification of the protein's amino terminus, which is highly conserved among Pti1 orthologs in several plant species. Importantly, mislocalization of OsPti1a after deletion of its amino terminus reduced its ability to complement the mutant phenotypes, including hypersensitive response-like cell death. Furthermore, complex formation of OsPti1a depends on its amino terminus-mediated membrane localization. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of OsPti1a complex-interacting proteins identified several defense-related proteins. Collectively, these findings indicate that appropriate complex formation by OsPti1a at the plasma membrane is required for the negative regulation of plant immune responses in rice.",10.1104/pp.114.243873,True,high,True,high,"[""Oryza sativa""]","[""lipid modification"", ""plasma membrane localization"", ""plant immunity""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Oryza sativa""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Here, we report that OsPti1a localizes to detergent\u2011resistant membrane fractions of the plasma membrane through lipid modification of the protein's amino terminus, which is highly conserved among Pti1 orthologs in several plant species.""], ""explanation"": ""The study demonstrates that lipid modification of OsPti1a\u2019s N\u2011terminus directs its localization to the plasma membrane, a key step for its role in negatively regulating plant immune responses."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid modification"", ""plasma membrane localization"", ""plant immunity""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",8: Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes,success,8.0,Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes
15190066,Lipid rafts in higher plant cells: purification and characterization of Triton X-100-insoluble microdomains from tobacco plasma membrane.,"A large body of evidence from the past decade supports the existence of functional microdomains in membranes of animal and yeast cells, which play important roles in protein sorting, signal transduction, or infection by pathogens. They are based on the dynamic clustering of sphingolipids and cholesterol or ergosterol and are characterized by their insolubility, at low temperature, in nonionic detergents. Here we show that similar microdomains also exist in plant plasma membrane isolated from both tobacco leaves and BY2 cells. Tobacco lipid rafts were found to be greatly enriched in a sphingolipid, identified as glycosylceramide, as well as in a mixture of stigmasterol, sitosterol, 24-methylcholesterol, and cholesterol. Phospho- and glycoglycerolipids of the plasma membrane were largely excluded from lipid rafts. Membrane proteins were separated by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identified by tandem mass spectrometry or use of specific antibody. The data clearly indicate that tobacco microdomains are able to recruit a specific set of the plasma membrane proteins and exclude others. We demonstrate the recruitment of the NADPH oxidase after elicitation by cryptogein and the presence of the small G protein NtRac5, a negative regulator of NADPH oxidase, in lipid rafts.",10.1074/jbc.M403440200,True,high,True,high,"[""Nicotiana tabacum""]","[""sphingolipids"", ""sterols"", ""lipid rafts"", ""plasma membrane microdomains""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Nicotiana tabacum""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Tobacco lipid rafts were found to be greatly enriched in a sphingolipid, identified as glycosylceramide, as well as in a mixture of stigmasterol, sitosterol, 24-methylcholesterol, and cholesterol."", ""Phospho- and glycoglycerolipids of the plasma membrane were largely excluded from lipid rafts.""], ""explanation"": ""The study characterizes the lipid composition of plant plasma membrane microdomains, focusing on sphingolipids and sterols that define lipid rafts, thereby directly addressing lipid biochemistry in plants."", ""specific_topics"": [""sphingolipids"", ""sterols"", ""lipid rafts"", ""plasma membrane microdomains""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",8: Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes,success,8.0,Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes
24738983,Subcellular localization of rice acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs) indicates that OsACBP6::GFP is targeted to the peroxisomes.,"Acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs) show conservation at the acyl-CoA-binding (ACB) domain which facilitates binding to acyl-CoA esters. In Arabidopsis thaliana, six ACBPs participate in development and stress responses. Rice (Oryza sativa) also contains six genes encoding ACBPs. We investigated differences in subcellular localization between monocot rice and eudicot A. thaliana ACBPs. The subcellular localization of the six OsACBPs was achieved via transient expression of green fluorescence protein (GFP) fusions in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) epidermal cells, and stable transformation of A. thaliana. As plant ACBPs had not been reported in the peroxisomes, OsACBP6::GFP localization was confirmed by transient expression in rice sheath cells. The function of OsACBP6 was investigated by overexpressing 35S::OsACBP6 in the peroxisomal abc transporter1 (pxa1) mutant defective in peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation. As predicted, OsACBP1::GFP and OsACBP2::GFP were localized to the cytosol, and OsACBP4::GFP and OsACBP5::GFP to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, OsACBP3::GFP displayed subcellular multi-localization while OsACBP6::GFP was localized to the peroxisomes. 35S::OsACBP6-OE/pxa1 lines showed recovery in indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) peroxisomal β-oxidation, wound-induced VEGETATIVE STORAGE PROTEIN1 (VSP1) expression and jasmonic acid (JA) accumulation.

On lipid bodies of germinating cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) seedlings, the modification of linoleoyl moieties by this LOX precedes the hydrolysis of the ester bonds. We analyzed the expression and intracellular location of this particular LOX form in leaves and seeds of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) transformed with one construct coding for cucumber lipid-body LOX and one construct coding for cucumber LOX fused with a hemagglutinin epitope. In both tissues, the amount of lipid-body LOX was clearly detectable. Biochemical analysis revealed that in mature seeds the foreign LOX was targeted to lipid bodies, and the preferred location of the LOX on lipid bodies was verified by immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells of the endosperm and of the embryo exhibited fluorescence based on the immunodecoration of LOX protein whereas very weak fluorescent label was visible in seeds of untransformed control plants. Further cytochemical analysis of transformed plants showed that the LOX protein accumulated in the cytoplasm when green leaves lacking lipid bodies were analyzed.

18212025,Phospholipids are present in extracellular fluids of imbibing sunflower seeds and are modulated by hormonal treatments.,"Phospholipids are well known messengers involved in developmental and stress responses mediating intracellular signalling. It has been hypothesized that phospholipids exist which could participate in intercellular communication events through the apoplast of sunflower (Helianthus annuus) seeds. Here it is shown that extracellular washing fluids (EWFs) obtained from seeds imbibed for 2 h contain diverse phospholipids. Lipid profiling by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry revealed that the EWFs have a particular composition, with phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) being the major phospholipids. These profiles are clearly distinct from those of seed extract (SE), and comparative SDS-PAGE of EWF and SE, followed by intracellular and plasma membrane marker analyses, allowed a significant contamination of the EWF to be discarded. Treatment of the seeds with 100 microM jasmonic acid (JA) induces changes in the profile of EWF phospholipids, leading to a decrease in PI content, while the accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) and specific PA species is observed. On the other hand, the EWF from seeds subjected to 50 microM abscisic acid (ABA) treatment exhibit an increase in PA and phosphatidylglycerol levels. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the existence of phospholipids as extracellular components of seeds.

25489022,Protein phosphatase 2A holoenzyme is targeted to peroxisomes by piggybacking and positively affects peroxisomal β-oxidation.,"The eukaryotic, highly conserved serine (Ser)/threonine-specific protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) functions as a heterotrimeric complex composed of a catalytic (C), scaffolding (A), and regulatory (B) subunit. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), five, three, and 17 genes encode different C, A, and B subunits, respectively. We previously found that a B subunit, B'θ, localized to peroxisomes due to its C-terminal targeting signal Ser-Ser-leucine. This work shows that PP2A C2, C5, andA2 subunits interact and colocalize with B'θ in peroxisomes. C and A subunits lack peroxisomal targeting signals, and their peroxisomal import depends on B'θ and appears to occur by piggybacking transport. B'θ knockout mutants were impaired in peroxisomal β-oxidation as shown by developmental arrest of seedlings germinated without sucrose, accumulation of eicosenoic acid, and resistance to protoauxins indole-butyric acid and 2,4-dichlorophenoxybutyric acid.

Biochemical investigations in the recent past have also demonstrated the expression of calcium-binding proteins, called caleosins, as a component of oil body membranes during seed germination. Using DM-Bodipy-phenylalkylamine (PAA; a fluorescent derivative of phenylalkylamine)-a fluorescent probe known to bind L-type calcium channel proteins, present investigations provide the first report on the localization and preferential accumulation of putative calcium channel proteins on/around oil bodies during peak lipolytic phase in protoplasts derived from dark-grown sunflower (Helianthus annuus L. cv Morden) seedling cotyledons.

10188600,The isolation and characterization of right-side-out plasma membrane vesicles from barley aleurone cells.,"Examination of organelle- and membrane-specific processes such as signal transduction necessitates the use of plasma membrane vesicles with cytoplasmic side-in orientation. We are interested in the structural identity and subcellular localization of in vivo [32P]phosphoric acid ([32Pi])-labeled phosphoinositides, including the recently discovered phosphatidyl-scyllo-inositol, for signal transduction studies. In the first part of this investigation, plasma membrane vesicles from barley aleurone cells were isolated employing the aqueous polymer (Dextran and polyethylene glycol) two-phase partition method. The membrane vesicles that partitioned into the upper and lower phases of the aqueous polymer two-phase system were characterized and the purity of the vesicles ascertained by assaying for two marker enzymes, K+-stimulated, Mg2+-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.3, ATPase), localized in the plasma membranes, and cytochrome c oxidase, localized in the mitochondria. Inhibitors for ATPases such as azide, molybdate, and vanadate were used to distinguish between plasma membrane-associated and intracellular membrane-associated ATPases. These inhibitor studies suggest that the plasma membrane preparation contained about 7% of intracellular membrane vesicles and the intracellular membrane fraction contained about 6% of plasma membrane vesicles. Orientation of the plasma membrane vesicles was ascertained by measuring the latent ATPase activity. These latency studies suggest that about 95% of the plasma membrane vesicles were of cytoplasmic side-in orientation. In the second part of this investigation, intracellular distribution and in vivo [32Pi] labeling of phosphoinositides in the plasma membranes and intracellular membranes were investigated. Preferential accumulation of [32Pi]-labeled phosphatidyl-myo-inositol monophosphate (myo-PIP) and phosphatidyl-myo-inositol bisphosphate (myo-PIP2) was observed in the plasma membrane. However, scyllo-phosphatidylinositol (scyllo-PI) was detected in both the plasma membrane and the intracellular membranes.

11006340,Association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with nuclear transcription sites in higher plants.,"The kinases responsible for phosphorylation of inositol-containing lipids are essential for many aspects of normal eukaryotic cell function. Genetic and biochemical studies have established that the phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-kinase encoded by the yeast VPS34 gene is essential for the efficient sorting and delivery of proteins to the vacuole; the kinase encoded by the human VPS34 homolog has been equally implicated in the control of intracellular vesicle traffic. The plant VPS34 homolog also is required for normal growth and development, and although a role for PtdIns 3-kinase in vesicle trafficking is likely, it has not been established. In this study, we have shown that considerable PtdIns 3-kinase activity is associated with the internal matrix of nuclei isolated from carrot suspension cells. Immunocytochemical and confocal laser scanning microscopy studies using the monoclonal antibody JIM135 (John Innes Monoclonal 135), raised against a truncated version of the soybean PtdIns 3-kinase, SPI3K-5p, revealed that this kinase appears to have a distinct and punctate distribution within the plant nucleus and nucleolus. Dual probing of root sections with JIM135 and anti-bromo-UTP antibodies, after in vitro transcription had been allowed to proceed in the presence of bromo-UTP, showed that SPI3K-5p associates with active nuclear and nucleolar transcription sites.

3988805,Localization of phosphatidylcholine in outer envelope membrane of spinach chloroplasts.,"We have examined the effects of phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus on the extent of phospholipid hydrolysis in envelope membrane vesicles and in intact chloroplasts. When isolated envelope vesicles were incubated in presence of phospholipase C, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol, but not phosphatidylinositol, were totally converted into diacylglycerol if they were available to the enzyme (i.e., when the vesicles were sonicated in presence of phospholipase C). These experiments demonstrate that phospholipase C can be used to probe the availability of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol in the cytosolic leaflet of the outer envelope membrane from spinach chloroplasts. When isolated, purified, intact chloroplasts were incubated with low amounts of phospholipase C (0.3 U/mg chlorophyll) under very mild conditions (12 degrees C for 1 min), greater than 80% of phosphatidylcholine molecules and almost none of phosphatidylglycerol molecules were hydrolyzed. Since we have also demonstrated, by using several different methods (phase-contrast and electron microscopy, immunochemical and electrophoretic analyses) that isolated spinach chloroplasts, and especially their outer envelope membrane, remained intact after mild treatment with phospholipase C, we can conclude that there is a marked asymmetric distribution of phospholipids across the outer envelope membrane of spinach chloroplasts. Phosphatidylcholine, the major polar lipid of the outer envelope membrane, is almost entirely accessible from the cytosolic side of the membrane and therefore is probably localized in the outer leaflet of the outer envelope bilayer. On the contrary, phosphatidylglycerol, the major polar lipid in the inner envelope membrane and the thylakoids, is probably not accessible to phospholipase C from the cytosol and therefore is probably localized mostly in the inner leaflet of the outer envelope membrane and in the other chloroplast membranes.",10.1083/jcb.100.5.1690,True,high,True,high,"[""Spinacia oleracea""]","[""phosphatidylcholine localization"", ""phospholipase C activity"", ""chloroplast membrane asymmetry""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Spinacia oleracea""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""When isolated envelope vesicles were incubated in presence of phospholipase C, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol, but not phosphatidylinositol, were totally converted into diacylglycerol if they were available to the enzyme (i.e., when the vesicles were sonicated in presence of phospholipase C)."", ""These experiments demonstrate that phospholipase C can be used to probe the availability of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol in the cytosolic leaflet of the outer envelope membrane from spinach chloroplasts.""], ""explanation"": ""The manuscript focuses on the enzymatic hydrolysis of specific phospholipids\u2014phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol\u2014in spinach chloroplast membranes, thereby directly investigating lipid composition and distribution."", ""specific_topics"": [""phosphatidylcholine localization"", ""phospholipase C activity"", ""chloroplast membrane asymmetry""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",8: Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes,success,8.0,Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes
16649109,The highly charged region of plant beta-type phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase is involved in membrane targeting and phospholipid binding.,"In Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, two types of PI 4-kinase (PI4Ks) have been isolated and functionally characterized. The alpha-type PI4Ks (approximately 220 kDa) contain a PH domain, which is lacking in beta-type PI4Ks (approximately 120 kDa). Beta-type PI4Ks, exemplified by Arabidopsis AtPI4Kbeta and rice OsPI4K2, contain a highly charged repetitive segment designated PPC (Plant PI4K Charged) region, which is an unique domain only found in plant beta-type PI4Ks at present. The PPC region has a length of approximately 300 amino acids and harboring 11 (AtPI4Kbeta) and 14 (OsPI4K2) repeats, respectively, of a 20-aa motif. Studies employing a modified yeast-based ""Sequence of Membrane-Targeting Detection"" system demonstrate that the PPC(OsPI4K2) region, as well as the former 8 and latter 6 repetitive motifs within the PPC region, are able to target fusion proteins to the plasma membrane. Further detection on the transiently expressed GFP fusion proteins in onion epidermal cells showed that the PPC(OsPI4K2) region alone, as well as the region containing repetitive motifs 1-8, was able to direct GFP to the plasma membrane, while the regions containing less repetitive motifs, i.e. 6, 4, 2 or single motif(s) led to predominantly intracellular localization. Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression of PPC-GFP fusion protein further confirms the membrane-targeting capacities of PPC region. In addition, the predominant plasma membrane localization of AtPI4Kbeta was mediated by the PPC region.

In eukaryotes, the plasma membrane (PM) is the most electronegative compartment of the cell, which specifies its identity. As such, membrane electrostatics is a central parameter in signaling, intracellular trafficking, and polarity. Here, we explore which are the lipids that control membrane electrostatics using plants as a model. We show that phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P), phosphatidic acidic (PA), and phosphatidylserine (PS) are separately required to generate the electrostatic signature of the plant PM. In addition, we reveal the existence of an electrostatic territory that is organized as a gradient along the endocytic pathway and is controlled by PS/PI4P combination.

30104351,"Phosphoinositides control the localization of HOPS subunit VPS41, which together with VPS33 mediates vacuole fusion in plants.","The vacuole is an essential organelle in plant cells, and its dynamic nature is important for plant growth and development. Homotypic membrane fusion is required for vacuole biogenesis, pollen germination, stomata opening, and gravity perception. Known components of the vacuole fusion machinery in eukaryotes include SNARE proteins, Rab GTPases, phosphoinositides, and the homotypic fusion and vacuolar protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex. HOPS function is not well characterized in plants, but roles in embryogenesis and pollen tube elongation have been reported. Here, we show that <i>Arabidopsis</i> HOPS subunits VPS33 and VPS41 accumulate in late endosomes and that VPS41, but not VPS33, accumulates in the tonoplast via a wortmannin-sensitive process. VPS41 and VPS33 proteins bind to liposomes, but this binding is inhibited by phosphatidylinosiltol-3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] and PtdIns(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>, which implicates a nonconserved mechanism for HOPS recruitment in plants. Inducible knockdown of VPS41 resulted in dramatic vacuole fragmentation phenotypes and demonstrated a critical role for HOPS in vacuole fusion. Furthermore, we provide evidence for genetic interactions between VPS41 and VTI11 SNARE that regulate vacuole fusion, and the requirement of a functional SNARE complex for normal VPS41 and VPS33 localization. Finally, we provide evidence to support VPS33 and SYP22 at the initial stage for HOPS-SNARE interactions, which is similar to other eukaryotes.

28949830,Farnesylation-mediated subcellular localization is required for CYP85A2 function.,"Protein farnesylation refers to the addition of a 15-carbon farnesyl isoprenoid to the cysteine residue of the CaaX motif at the carboxy terminus of target proteins. In spite of its known roles in plant development and abiotic stress tolerance, how these processes are precisely regulated by farnesylation had remained elusive. We recently showed that CYP85A2, the cytochrome P450, which converts castasterone to brassinolide in the last step of brassinosteroid synthesis must be farnesylated in order to function in this pathway. Lack of either CYP85A2 or the farnesylation motif of CYP85A2 resulted in reduced brassinolide accumulation, hypersensitivity to ABA, and increased plant drought tolerance. In this study, we have assessed the influence of the N-terminal secretory signal and the C-terminal CaaX motif of CYP85A2 in mediating CYP85A2 function and targeting to endomembrane compartments. We show that CaaX motif could still target CYPA85A2 in the absence of an intact N-terminal secretory signal to the respective membrane compartments and partially rescue cyp85a2-2 phenotypes. However, in the absence of both the CaaX motif and the secretory signal, CYP85A2 is not targeted to the membranes and becomes unstable.",10.1080/15592324.2017.1382795,True,high,True,high,,"[""protein prenylation"", ""cytochrome P450 localization"", ""brassinosteroid biosynthesis""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": null, ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Protein farnesylation refers to the addition of a 15\u2011carbon farnesyl isoprenoid to the cysteine residue of the CaaX motif at the carboxy terminus of target proteins."", ""In this study, we have assessed the influence of the N\u2011terminal secretory signal and the C\u2011terminal CaaX motif of CYP85A2 in mediating CYP85A2 function and targeting to endomembrane compartments.""], ""explanation"": ""The study examines farnesylation, a post\u2011translational lipid modification involving the attachment of a farnesyl isoprenoid group to proteins, which directly relates to lipid biochemistry and cellular membrane dynamics."", ""specific_topics"": [""protein prenylation"", ""cytochrome P450 localization"", ""brassinosteroid biosynthesis""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",8: Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes,success,8.0,Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes
4177832,Lipid fixation during preparation of chloroplasts for electron microscopy.,"Reaction of osmium tetroxide with isolated spinach chloroplasts fixed completely the glycolipids, phosphatidyl glycerol, and phosphatidyl choline. Under the same reaction conditions only 30% of the chlorophyll was fixed. Reaction of potassium permanganate with isolated spinach chloroplasts fixed more than 90% of the glycolipids, phosphatidyl glycerol, and phosphatidyl choline, provided the reaction period was long enough. Potassium permanganate also fixed the chlorophyll. Reaction of osmium tetroxide and potassium permanganate with isolated (14)C-lipids from Chlorella pyrenoidosa fixed 59% and 66% of the radioactivity, respectively. The lipids that were not fixed included sterols and pigments. Electron micrographs show that chloroplasts extracted with chloroform-methanol after fixation in osmium tetroxide or potassium permanganate differ from those dehydrated with acetone mainly in that in the former, osmiophilic globules have been removed and there seems to be some fusion of the boundary membranes and grana membranes.

27405097,The proteome of higher plant mitochondria.,"Plant mitochondria perform a wide range of functions in the plant cell ranging from providing energy and metabolic intermediates, via coenzyme biosynthesis and their own biogenesis to retrograde signaling and programmed cell death. To perform these functions, they contain a proteome of >2000 different proteins expressed in some cells under some conditions. The vast majority of these proteins are imported, in many cases by a dedicated protein import machinery. Recent proteomic studies have identified about 1000 different proteins in both Arabidopsis and potato mitochondria, but even for energy-related proteins, the most well-studied functional protein group in mitochondria, <75% of the proteins are recognized as mitochondrial by even one of six of the most widely used prediction algorithms. The mitochondrial proteomes contain proteins representing a wide range of different functions. Some protein groups, like energy-related proteins, membrane transporters, and de novo fatty acid synthesis, appear to be well covered by the proteome, while others like RNA metabolism appear to be poorly covered possibly because of low abundance. The proteomic studies have improved our understanding of basic mitochondrial functions, have led to the discovery of new mitochondrial metabolic pathways and are helping us towards appreciating the dynamic role of the mitochondria in the responses of the plant cell to biotic and abiotic stress.",10.1016/j.mito.2016.07.002,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis"", ""potato""]","[""fatty acid synthesis"", ""lipid metabolism""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis"", ""potato""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Some protein groups, like energy-related proteins, membrane transporters, and de novo fatty acid synthesis, appear to be well covered by the proteome""], ""explanation"": ""The study reports identification of proteins involved in de novo fatty acid synthesis within plant mitochondria, demonstrating direct investigation of lipid-related processes."", ""specific_topics"": [""fatty acid synthesis"", ""lipid metabolism""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",8: Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes,success,8.0,Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes
24876254,Bipolar Plasma Membrane Distribution of Phosphoinositides and Their Requirement for Auxin-Mediated Cell Polarity and Patterning in Arabidopsis.,"Cell polarity manifested by asymmetric distribution of cargoes, such as receptors and transporters, within the plasma membrane (PM) is crucial for essential functions in multicellular organisms. In plants, cell polarity (re)establishment is intimately linked to patterning processes. Despite the importance of cell polarity, its underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown, including the definition and distinctiveness of the polar domains within the PM. Here, we show in Arabidopsis thaliana that the signaling membrane components, the phosphoinositides phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>] as well as PtdIns4P 5-kinases mediating their interconversion, are specifically enriched at apical and basal polar plasma membrane domains. The PtdIns4P 5-kinases PIP5K1 and PIP5K2 are redundantly required for polar localization of specifically apical and basal cargoes, such as PIN-FORMED transporters for the plant hormone auxin. As a consequence of the polarity defects, instructive auxin gradients as well as embryonic and postembryonic patterning are severely compromised. Furthermore, auxin itself regulates PIP5K transcription and PtdIns4P and PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels, in particular their association with polar PM domains. Our results provide insight into the polar domain-delineating mechanisms in plant cells that depend on apical and basal distribution of membrane lipids and are essential for embryonic and postembryonic patterning.",10.1105/tpc.114.126185,True,high,True,high,"[""Arabidopsis thaliana""]","[""phosphoinositide distribution"", ""lipid-mediated cell polarity"", ""auxin regulation of lipid kinases""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Arabidopsis thaliana""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""Here, we show in Arabidopsis thaliana that the signaling membrane components, the phosphoinositides phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P\u2082] as well as PtdIns4P 5\u2011kinases mediating their interconversion, are specifically enriched at apical and basal polar plasma membrane domains."", ""The PtdIns4P 5\u2011kinases PIP5K1 and PIP5K2 are redundantly required for polar localization of specifically apical and basal cargoes, such as PIN\u2011FORMED transporters for the plant hormone auxin.""], ""explanation"": ""The manuscript investigates the spatial distribution and functional role of phosphoinositide lipids (PtdIns4P and PtdIns(4,5)P\u2082) and their kinases in establishing cell polarity and auxin-mediated patterning in Arabidopsis, thereby directly addressing lipid biology."", ""specific_topics"": [""phosphoinositide distribution"", ""lipid-mediated cell polarity"", ""auxin regulation of lipid kinases""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",8: Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes,success,8.0,Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes
22440840,Wrapping membranes around plant virus infection.,"Positive strand RNA viruses cause membrane modifications which are microenvironments or larger intracellular compartments, also called 'viroplasms'. These compartments serve to concentrate virus and host factors needed to produce new genomes. Forming these replication sites often involves virus induced membrane synthesis, changes in fatty acid metabolism, and viral recruitment of cellular factors to subcellular domains. Interacting viral and host factors builds the physical scaffold for replication complexes. Such virus induced changes are a visible cytopathology that has been used by plant and mammalian virologists to describe virus disease.

25618761,Subcellular-level resolution MALDI-MS imaging of maize leaf metabolites by MALDI-linear ion trap-Orbitrap mass spectrometer.,"A significant limiting factor in achieving high spatial resolution for matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) imaging is the size of the laser spot at the sample surface. Here, we present modifications to the beam-delivery optics of a commercial MALDI-linear ion trap-Orbitrap instrument, incorporating an external Nd:YAG laser, beam-shaping optics, and an aspheric focusing lens, to reduce the minimum laser spot size from ~50 μm for the commercial configuration down to ~9 μm for the modified configuration. This improved system was applied for MALDI-MS imaging of cross sections of juvenile maize leaves at 5-μm spatial resolution using an oversampling method. A variety of different metabolites including amino acids, glycerolipids, and defense-related compounds were imaged at a spatial resolution well below the size of a single cell. Such images provide unprecedented insights into the metabolism associated with the different tissue types of the maize leaf, which is known to asymmetrically distribute the reactions of C4 photosynthesis among the mesophyll and bundle sheath cell types. The metabolite ion images correlate with the optical images that reveal the structures of the different tissues, and previously known and newly revealed asymmetric metabolic features are observed.",10.1007/s00216-015-8460-5,True,high,True,high,"[""Zea mays""]","[""lipid imaging"", ""glycerolipids"", ""metabolomics""]","{""task1_plant_research"": {""is_plant"": true, ""plant_species"": [""Zea mays""], ""confidence"": ""high""}, ""task2_lipid_relevance"": {""is_relevant"": true, ""evidence_sentences"": [""A variety of different metabolites including amino acids, glycerolipids, and defense\u2011related compounds were imaged at a spatial resolution well below the size of a single cell.""], ""explanation"": ""The abstract explicitly states that glycerolipids, a class of lipids, were among the metabolites imaged, demonstrating that the study investigates lipid molecules."", ""specific_topics"": [""lipid imaging"", ""glycerolipids"", ""metabolomics""], ""confidence"": ""high""}}",8: Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes,success,8.0,Subcellular Localization of Lipid-related Processes
